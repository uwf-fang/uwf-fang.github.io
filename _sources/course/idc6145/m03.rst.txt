Module 3: Data Processing For Big Data
**************************************
The definition of the term "data process" varies greatly between sources. Some
refer to it as a simple data transformation step. Some define it as the entire
process of big data application life cycle, including all stages defined here.
All of them are correct in their own context, but I'd like to define mine as
the second stage in the big data lifecycle to help with the teaching process.
