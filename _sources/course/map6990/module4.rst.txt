Product of Data Analysis
========================
introduce the data analysis step. It may create various products such as
1. reports and visualization
2. machine learning/deep learning models
3. optimized algorithm/procedure
It should also have various types such as exploratory data analysis and other types


Types of Data Analysis
======================
There are various types of data analysis that can be performed on big data. Some of the most common types include:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): EDA is a method of analyzing data to summarize its main characteristics and identify patterns and relationships in the data. EDA involves visualizing the data, identifying outliers, and performing statistical tests to uncover insights and patterns.

Descriptive analysis: Descriptive analysis involves summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset, such as measures of central tendency, variability, and correlation. This type of analysis can help to identify trends and patterns in the data.

Diagnostic analysis: Diagnostic analysis involves analyzing data to identify the causes of problems or issues in a system. This type of analysis is often used to identify the root cause of issues and develop solutions to address them.

Predictive analysis: Predictive analysis involves using statistical models or machine learning algorithms to analyze data and make predictions about future events or trends. This type of analysis is often used for forecasting and predicting outcomes.

Prescriptive analysis: Prescriptive analysis involves analyzing data to determine the best course of action to achieve a desired outcome. This type of analysis is often used in decision-making processes to optimize outcomes and improve performance.

Overall, the type of data analysis used depends on the specific business problem or question being addressed, and the available data and resources.
