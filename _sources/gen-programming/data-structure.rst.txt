Definition
==========
A data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science, representing a
specialized way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory or
storage system. It defines the layout and relationships between data elements,
facilitating efficient operations such as insertion, retrieval, and deletion.
Data structures can vary in complexity and purpose, ranging from simple
structures like arrays and linked lists to more complex ones like trees,
graphs, and hash tables. The choice of an appropriate data structure is crucial
in designing efficient algorithms and solving specific computational problems
effectively.

Context
=======
+ May be an implementation of an abstract data type
+ May be required by an algorithm
+ May contain other data structures
+ May contain algorithms

Characteristics
===============
+ Organization: Data structures define how data is arranged, stored, and
  accessed. They determine the format and layout of data elements within a data
  structure.
+ Operations: Data structures often come with a set of operations or methods
  that can be performed on the data they hold. These operations include
  inserting, deleting, updating, and retrieving data elements.
+ Efficiency: The choice of a data structure can significantly impact the
  efficiency of algorithms and operations that use that data structure. Some
  data structures are optimized for specific types of operations, such as
  searching or sorting.
+ Memory Management: Data structures efficiently allocate memory to store data
  elements and manage that memory. Effective memory management is crucial for
  optimizing resource usage.
