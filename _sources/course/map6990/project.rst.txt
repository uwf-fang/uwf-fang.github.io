Learning outcome
================
+ Practice scientific background research
+ Practice how to design a big data application
+ Practice scientific background review writing
+ Practice scientific proposal writing

Objective
=========
Write a proposal like article on a big data problem you want to solve. In this report, you must:

1. Identify the problem (1 page)

   The data source must be big data. The problem must be big data problem. The
   problem must be interesting and challenging. The data should be either big
   in volume or too complex for traditional machine learning model (text,
   image, sound, etc). It means that your dataset can be either very big or
   small but too complex for traditional ML. You must have a good understanding
   of the dataset you plan to use. For data with big volume, you can use the
   processing tools to make it small enough for analysis. For complex data, you
   can either use some special tools to convert them or find the right deep
   learning models to directly consume them.

2. Review the background (2-3 pages)

   You must review the background of the problem. Carefully review the related
   articles and justify why your problem is big data and why it is interesting
   and challenging. The review should be systematic and comprehensive. Employ
   what you have learning in the course to organize the information you found.

3. Propose your solution (1-2 pages)

   You must propose a solution to the problem. The solution must be feasible
   and interesting. The solution should be based on the knowledge you have
   learned in the course. The solution must be well justified. You do not need
   to provide a lot of details. You can provide a high level overview of the
   solution. List the steps of how you will go though the big data life cycle.
   List the tools you plan to use in each stage of the big data application.
   Also discuss how you are going to address all of the aspects in the big data
   life cycle. Details on how to used the tools are not required. You can
   provide a high level overview of how you will use the tools. You can also
   discuss the pros and cons of the tools you plan to use.

Report Requirement
==================
+ 4-5 pages letter size paper, 1.5 spacing, 12pt normal text font
+ Be organized and neat with headings, styles to separate sections
+ You can either use LaTeX or Microsoft Word
+ Provide image, figure, table, as needed; Do not forget to provide credit to
  the source of the image, figure, table
+ Use `MLA style <mla_>`_ for citation and reference

Potential Topics
================
Data sources
------------
+ Image datasets: Image datasets are widely available online and can be used
  for a variety of projects, such as object recognition, image classification,
  and facial recognition. Some popular image datasets include CIFAR-10, MNIST,
  and ImageNet.
+ Text datasets: Text datasets can be used for natural language processing
  (NLP) projects, such as sentiment analysis, language modeling, and text
  classification. Some popular text datasets include the Reuters Corpus, the
  IMDB movie review dataset, and the Gutenberg Project.
+ Audio datasets: Audio datasets can be used for speech recognition and music
  analysis projects. Some popular audio datasets include the Speech Commands
  dataset, the UrbanSound8K dataset, and the Million Song Dataset.
+ Social media datasets: Social media datasets can be used for sentiment
  analysis, network analysis, and other social media-related projects. Some
  popular social media datasets include the Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset,
  the Reddit Comment dataset, and the Facebook100 dataset.
+ Health-related datasets: Health-related datasets can be used for projects
  related to healthcare, such as disease prediction and drug discovery. Some
  popular health-related datasets include the MIMIC-III dataset, the Breast
  Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, and the National Health and Nutrition
  Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset.
