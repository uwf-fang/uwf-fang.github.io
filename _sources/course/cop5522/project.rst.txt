Learning outcome
================
+ Learn teamwork on group projects
+ Practice scientific article writing
+ Practice academic research workflow

Objective
=========
Propose parallel implementations of known serial algorithms as an performance
optimization. Implement the design, evaluate the optimizations and discuss the
result.

Typical Steps
=============
+ Identify the problem
+ Propose solutions
+ Implement your solutions
+ Plan experiments
+ Evaluate the optimizations
+ Discuss the results
+ Conclude the project

Assessment
==========
The project is assess in three stages:
1. Proposal

   Make a 1 page proposal to describe the problem you plan to solve, the
   background, the approaches you plan to employ, the expected outcome, the
   time frame to finish stages of the project, the cooperation plan, etc. You
   may also want to identify the potential challenges here.

1. Progress report

   Make a 1 page progress report on the project. List works finished so far and
   to be done in the future. Discuss challenges encountered, adjustments to the
   plan, etc. also.

1. Final report

   Make a formal report on the project. You may want to follow a professional scientific article format.
