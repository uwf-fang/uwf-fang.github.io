# Windows SSH Authentication Setup Guide

## Introduction
I'll guide you through setting up SSH key authentication for accessing our CS
server (cs-ssh.uwf.edu). This method is both more secure and convenient than
traditional password authentication, eliminating the need to enter your
password each time you connect.

## Key Concepts

### Public Key Authentication
SSH key authentication uses a pair of cryptographic keys:

* **Public Key**: Like a padlock that you can freely share. It's placed on the
  server you want to access.
* **Private Key**: Like the unique key that opens your padlock. Must be kept
  secret and secure on your computer.

### Benefits
* Increased security through cryptographic strength
* No need to remember or type passwords
* Protection against brute-force attacks
* Automated secure file transfers and remote operations

## Installing OpenSSH on Windows

.. note::

    Pre-installed on classroom computers.

### Using Windows Settings (Recommended)
1. Open Windows Settings
2. Navigate to Apps -> Optional Features
3. Click "Add a feature"
4. Search for "OpenSSH Client"
5. Click Install

### Verify Installation
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and type:
```powershell
ssh -V
```
This should display the OpenSSH version number.

## Generating SSH Key Pair

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Generate the key pair:
```powershell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@uwf.edu"
```
3. When prompted for file location, press Enter to accept the default:
   - Default location: `C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\id_ed25519`
4. Optional: Enter a passphrase (recommended) or press Enter twice for no passphrase

## Installing Public Key on Remote Server

### Method 1: Using PowerShell
```powershell
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | ssh your_username@cs-ssh.uwf.edu "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

### Method 2: Manual Copy-Paste
1. Open your public key file:
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste it at the end of the `


## Testing SSH Connection

In your powershell terminal:
```powershell
ssh your_username@cs-ssh.uwf.edu
```
You should connect without being prompted for a password.

## Best Practices

1. Key Management:
   - Keep private key secure
   - Never share private key
   - Use a strong passphrase
   - Back up `.ssh` folder
