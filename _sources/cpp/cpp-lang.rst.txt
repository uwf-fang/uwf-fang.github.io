************************
C++ programming language
************************
A high-level compiled, typed, object-oriented, class-based, and general purpose
programming language.

.. _coding-style:

Naming convention required in class
===================================
We use a common naming convention in the class:

:Type, and class names: UpperCamelCase (Pascal case)
:Function, variable names: lowerCamelCase
:Constant and Macro names: ALL_UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE
:Header file extension: hpp
:Source code file extension: cpp
:File names: all-lowercase-with-hyphen.cpp

Compilation Requirement in Class
================================
In this course, we stick to the C++14 standard for consistency. Always add
``-std=c++14`` flag to the ``g++`` commands during compilation.

Best practices in C++
=====================
There are some great guidelines on how to code correct and efficient programs
in C++. They are long but worth reading if you plan to use C++ in real-life
projects:

+ The `C++ Core Guideline`_.
+ The `Google C++ Style Guide`_.

Errors
======
Three types of errors for C++ as a typical compiled programming language:

.. glossary::

  Syntax error
    Also known as compilation error. It will be identified by the compiler and
    will stop the compilation process. Any program with syntax errors cannot be
    compiled.

  Runtime error
    Errors that abort a compiled program during its runtime. Any program with
    runtime errors can be compiled but will abort when it is executed.

  Logic error
    Errors that cause a program to provide unexpected outcome. Any program with
    logic errors can compile and run but fail to give the correct outcome.

Hello World in C++
==================

::

  #include <iostream>   // to include a system header to enable input/output
  #include <string>   // to include a system header to enable string type
  using namespace std;  // to avoid typing std:: in front of many common keywords

  int main() {
    string name;  // string variable called name
    cout << "What is your name? (use one word) "; // display to the screen
    cin >> name;  // read from keyboard input
    cout << "Hello " << name << " " << endl;

    return 0;  // 0 means success, better use EXIT_SUCCESS constant
  }
