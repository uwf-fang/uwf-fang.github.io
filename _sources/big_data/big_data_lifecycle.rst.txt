Big Data Life Cycle
*******************

Introduction
------------
In today's data-driven world, organizations are collecting and processing vast
amounts of data to gain insights and make informed decisions. This is where the
concept of the big data life cycle comes in. The big data life cycle refers to
the process of acquiring, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data in a
structured and efficient manner. It involves various stages, including data
acquisition, data processing, and data analysis, with each stage having its own
unique challenges and considerations. By following a well-defined big data life
cycle, organizations can make sense of their data, gain valuable insights, and
use this information to improve business operations, customer satisfaction, and
overall performance.

There are aspects of the life cycle that are involved in multiple stages at the
same time. In this course, three aspects are covered: data storage, data
security and privacy, and data governance and management.

It's important to note that there are many different perspectives and
approaches to defining the big data life cycle. Our interpretation is just one
of many, and it may not encompass all aspects of the process. Each organization
may have its own unique requirements and challenges when it comes to handling
and analyzing big data. Therefore, it's essential to be flexible and adaptable
in defining the life cycle and to tailor it to fit specific business needs. By
understanding the various perspectives on the big data life cycle,
organizations can develop a comprehensive and effective approach to managing
their data.

Stages
------
While the stages of the big data life cycle we have defined below are common
and critical components of most big data applications, it's important to note
that these stages are not necessarily sequential and can be iterative. For
example, data analysis may reveal insights that require additional data to be
acquired or processed, leading to a cycle of continuous improvement.
Additionally, while these stages are independent, they are interconnected and
can impact each other. For instance, poor data quality or incomplete data
acquired during the data acquisition stage can negatively impact data
processing and analysis. Therefore, it's essential to have a holistic approach
to the big data life cycle, where each stage is viewed as part of a larger
whole, and improvements are made iteratively across all stages to achieve the
best outcomes.

+ Data acquisition

  In this stage, data is collected from various sources such as sensors, social
  media, customer records, and other databases. The data can be either
  structured or unstructured, and the challenge is to identify relevant data
  that can be used for analysis. Some of the common data acquisition methods
  include web scraping, surveys, and machine-generated data.

+ Data processing

  Data processing is a critical component of the big data life cycle, where raw
  data is transformed into a format that can be used for analysis. In our
  perspective, the data processing stage encompasses a range of activities,
  from data cleaning and filtering to data integration and enrichment. It is a
  complex and iterative process that involves both human and machine-based
  methods, such as data wrangling, data normalization, and data mapping. The
  goal of data processing is to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and
  consistent, and can be analyzed effectively to uncover insights and drive
  decision-making. The specific techniques and tools used in data processing
  may vary depending on the context and the available resources, but a
  well-defined and systematic approach is essential to ensure the success of
  the big data application.

+ Data analysis

  The data analysis step is a critical component of the big data life cycle,
  where insights and knowledge are extracted from the processed data. This step
  involves various techniques such as statistical analysis, machine learning,
  deep learning, and visualization tools, to name a few. The outputs of the
  data analysis step can take many forms, including reports, dashboards, and
  visualizations, which can be used to communicate findings and insights to
  stakeholders. Machine learning and deep learning models can be developed to
  predict outcomes or classify data, while optimized algorithms or procedures
  can be created to improve business operations.

Aspects
-------
While the stages of the big data life cycle are typically independent and may
not always overlap, there are certain aspects that are involved in multiple
stages and require careful consideration throughout the entire life cycle. In
this course, we will focus on three such aspects: data storage, data security
and privacy, and data governance and management. These aspects play a critical
role in ensuring the success of the big data application and require attention
from the beginning to the end of the life cycle. Effective data storage is
essential to ensure that data is accessible and available for further
processing and analysis. Data security and privacy must be carefully managed to
protect sensitive information and maintain user trust. Finally, data governance
and management ensure that the data is effectively managed and utilized in a
way that aligns with organizational goals and objectives. By paying careful
attention to these aspects, we can ensure that our big data applications are
successful, secure, and ethical.

+ Data storage

  The majority of big data applications can be viewed as data pipelines, and
  various data storage services are required throughout the pipeline. After
  data acquisition, raw data are typically stored as unstructured or
  semi-structured data. In each small step of the data processing pipeline,
  data are transformed into increasingly structured forms, with intermediate
  datasets stored as semi-structured or structured data. The data analysis
  phase will also require a storage service for its outputs, including reports,
  visualization, and machine learning/deep learning models.

+ Data security and privacy

  Data security and privacy are critical considerations in big data
  applications due to the vast amounts of sensitive and personal data that are
  collected, processed, and analyzed. Big data applications often involve the
  collection of data from multiple sources, and this data may be combined and
  analyzed in ways that were not initially intended. This creates significant
  risks related to the security and privacy of the data. Data breaches or
  unauthorized access to sensitive data can result in severe consequences, such
  as financial loss, reputational damage, or even legal action.

  To mitigate these risks, big data applications need to implement robust data
  security and privacy measures. This includes encryption of data both in
  transit and at rest, access controls to limit who can access the data, and
  regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
  Additionally, data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA may
  apply to certain types of data, and big data applications need to ensure
  compliance with these regulations.

+ Data governance and management

  Data governance and management are essential aspects of big data applications
  that ensure that data is managed effectively and in alignment with
  organizational goals and objectives. Data governance involves defining
  policies, procedures, and standards for managing and using data, while data
  management focuses on the practical implementation of these policies and
  procedures.

  Effective data governance and management in big data applications involve
  several key activities, such as data quality management, data integration,
  and data lifecycle management. Data quality management ensures that data is
  accurate, consistent, and up-to-date, and it involves processes such as data
  profiling, data cleansing, and data validation. Data integration involves the
  consolidation of data from various sources to provide a unified view of the
  data, and it may require the use of technologies such as ETL (Extract,
  Transform, Load) tools or data virtualization. Data lifecycle management
  ensures that data is managed effectively throughout its entire lifecycle,
  from acquisition to disposal, and it involves activities such as data
  retention, archiving, and data destruction.

  In addition to these activities, effective data governance and management in
  big data applications also involve ensuring compliance with applicable
  regulations and standards, such as GDPR, CCPA, or ISO 27001. It also requires
  collaboration and communication between different stakeholders, such as data
  scientists, data analysts, and IT teams, to ensure that data is managed
  effectively and in alignment with organizational goals.
