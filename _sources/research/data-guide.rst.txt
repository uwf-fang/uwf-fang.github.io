Data Guide
**********

Navigating the world of data requires a grasp of its three pivotal stages:
collection, processing, and presentation. Our guide offers a concise overview,
taking you from gathering raw data to refining and presenting it in a
comprehensible manner. Ideal for both beginners and seasoned practitioners,
this guide sharpens your understanding of effective data management.

Data Collection
===============
+ For every experiment you conduct, record the data in a dedicated row.
+ Ensure that the organization of your raw data remains simple. This will
  facilitate smoother processing later on.

Data Processing
===============
**Derived Fields**:
   After collecting your data, and before moving on to pivot tables, you might
   need to generate additional fields (columns). This is especially useful when
   you want to perform computations based on the existing data fields.

   - For instance, if you have columns "Price" and "Quantity", you can derive a
     new field "Total" by multiplying these two.

   Up" field is calculated by dividing the "Serial Time" by the "Parallel
   Time".

Generating Views with Pivot Tables
==================================
+ Use pivot tables to generate a structured view of your data.
+ Organize your pivot table in the following manner:
   - **X-Axis (Rows)**: Contains the variables you want to study.
   - **Series (Columns)**: This is where you separate out the different
     conditions or variations of your experiment.
   - **Y-values (Cell Data)**: These are the results or observations from your
     experiment.

Plotting Your Data:
===================
- With the structured data format (as mentioned in the pivot table section),
  several tools can be utilized to visualize the results:

   - **Google Sheets**: Offers native support for creating various types of
     charts and plots.
   - **Python Libraries**:

      - **Matplotlib**: A basic, yet powerful, plotting library.
      - **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, it provides a higher-level
        interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
      - **Pandas**: Primarily a data manipulation library, but has plotting
        capabilities built on Matplotlib.

Key Takeaways
=============
+ Keep your raw data structure simple and organized.
+ Don't hesitate to derive new fields from existing data, especially if they
  provide new insights or simplify further processing.
+ Pivot tables are invaluable tools for creating structured data views, making
  data visualization significantly easier.
+ Multiple tools are available for data visualization; choose the one that best
  fits your needs.
