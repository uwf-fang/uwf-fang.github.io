Vector Abstract Data Type (ADT)
===============================
+ A vector can be treated as an ADT, when focusing on the data organization and
  behaviors only. Implementations are not defined.
+ Vector: A sequential ADT, similar to list ADT
+ Behaviors

  * access by index
  * insert remove by index
  * check size/empty

C++ std::vector
===============
+ A C++ implementation of the Vector ADT
+ An STL container
+ ``#include <vector>``
+ vector is a class template, not a type! ``vector<int>`` is a class type
+ Based on a dynamic array internally

  * fast access by indexing
  * slow erase/insert in the middle
  * may re-allocate memory when out of space (capacity)

    - create a larger array
    - duplicate/move all elements from existing array
    - delete the existing array

  * resize

+ Variable length allowed
+ Out-of-boundary check with ``.at(n)`` method
+ automatic memory re-allocation
+ Methods

  * Constructors

    - default:  empty vector
    - ``(n)``:  vector of size n, default values
    - ``(n, v)``:  vector of size n, fill values as v
    - ``(aVectorOfSameType)``:  copy another vector, must be same base type
    - ``{item1, item2, ...}``:  fill items from index 0

  * Operator =

    - ``v1 = {1, 2, 3}``: initializer_list assignment
    - ``v1 = v2``: copy assignment

  * ``at()``

    - can assign value like ``v.at(0) = 10;``
    - with boundary check. Triggers out_of_boundary exception
    - preferred over ``[]`` syntax

  * ``clear()`` clear the content
  * ``empty()`` check empty
  * ``size()``
  * ``push_back()``

    - push the value as the last element
    - does not return value

  * ``pop_back()``

    - removes the last element
    - **does not return value! Be careful! Many pop methods in other languages
      returns a value.**

  * ``back()``

    - returns the value of the last element

  * ``resize()``

    - may or may not re-allocate memory
    - does not erase data if downsized

  * ``insert()`` requires the use of iterators
  * ``erase()`` requires the use of iterators

Initialization
--------------
When the braces are used, the initialization will use the values as items. Must
use parentheses when triggering other constructors.

* ``vector<int> v{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`` size 5 vector with values
* ``vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`` size 5 vector with values
* ``vector<int> v(5)`` size 5 vector with 0s, ``v{5}`` will make a size 1 vector
* ``vector<int> v(5, 1)`` size 5 vector with 1s, ``v{5, 1}`` will make a size 2
  vector
* ``vector<int> v1(v)`` make a copy of v

.. vector-pitfalls:

Pitfalls
--------
* use [] rather than at()
* ``int a = v.pop_back();`` should be ``int a = v.back(); v.pop_back()``
* ``cout << v.length();`` Wrong! There is no length() method
* ``if (v.size() == 0)`` this works but better use ``if (v.empty())``

Extended Readings
-----------------
* Use ``.emplace_back()`` with object vector
* Use for each loop with vectors
