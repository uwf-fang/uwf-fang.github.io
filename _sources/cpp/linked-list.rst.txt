Linked-List Data Structure
**************************
A linked-list is a sequential data structure implemented as linked nodes. Each
node typically contains one or more values and one or more links to neighboring
nodes.

Variations
==========
+ Minimal

  * head pointer only
  * singly-linked

+ Number of links per node

  * singly-linked - pointer to next node
  * doubly-linked - pointers to previous and next nodes

+ Terminal node handling

  * cyclic - last node point its next pointer to the first node (singly)
  * acyclic

+ Dummy node before the first node

  * simplifies empty list and first node handling

C++ Implementation Details
==========================
+ Classes

  * linked list class

    - head pointer
    - tail pointer

  * node class/struct

    - top-level class, not nested (preferred most of the time)
    - nested class/struct (better information hiding)

+ Templated for more generic usages

Pitfalls
========
+ Linked-List is not an ADT. It is a data structure to be used to implement some
  ADTs.
+ Not handling empty list
+ Not handling the first/last element
