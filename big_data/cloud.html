<h1>Cloud Computing For Big Data<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-computing-for-big-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<section id="definition-of-cloud-computing">
<h2>Definition of Cloud Computing<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-cloud-computing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cloud computing is a model for delivering on-demand access to shared
computing resources (such as servers, storage, applications, and services)
over the internet. Big data refers to large and complex datasets that cannot
be processed or analyzed using traditional data processing methods. Combining
cloud computing with big data technologies can help businesses to manage,
store, process and analyze their large datasets.</p>
</section>
<section id="characteristics">
<h2>Characteristics<a class="headerlink" href="#characteristics" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On-demand self-service: With on-demand self-service, users can access cloud
computing resources and services quickly and easily, without needing to go
through IT personnel. For example, a business may use a cloud computing
service like Amazon Web Services (AWS) to spin up a cluster of virtual
machines to process a large dataset. With just a few clicks, the business
can provision the resources it needs and start processing data right away.</p></li>
<li><p>Broad network access: Broad network access allows users to access cloud
computing resources and services over the internet, enabling them to work
from anywhere using any kind of devices. For example, a data scientist may
need to access a large dataset stored in the cloud from their home office
or while traveling. With cloud computing, they can access the data from
anywhere with an internet connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Resource pooling: Resource pooling enables multiple users to share
computing resources and services, making it easier to scale up or down as
demand changes. For example, a business may use a cloud computing service
like Microsoft Azure to store and process large amounts of data. With
resource pooling, the business can easily scale up or down its computing
resources as needed, without needing to buy or maintain its own hardware.</p></li>
<li><p>Rapid elasticity: Rapid elasticity enables users to quickly scale up or
down their computing resources and services as needed. For example, a
business may need to process a large amount of data for a short period of
time, such as during a sales promotion. With cloud computing, the business
can quickly provision the additional resources it needs to handle the
workload, and then de-provision them when the promotion is over.</p></li>
<li><p>Measured service: Measured service provides users with visibility into
their usage of computing resources and services, enabling them to monitor
and control costs more effectively. For example, a business may use a cloud
computing service like Google Cloud Platform to store and process large
amounts of data. With measured service, the business can track its usage of
computing resources and services, and then adjust its usage to optimize
costs.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="advantages-of-cloud-computing">
<h2>Advantages of cloud computing<a class="headerlink" href="#advantages-of-cloud-computing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Cost-effective: One of the key advantages of cloud computing is its
cost-effectiveness. With cloud computing, businesses can avoid the high
upfront costs associated with purchasing and maintaining their own hardware
and software infrastructure. Instead, they can pay for computing resources
and services on an as-needed basis, which can be more cost-effective over
time. Additionally, cloud computing can help businesses to reduce their
energy costs and carbon footprint by enabling them to use computing
resources more efficiently. For example, a business may use a cloud-based
file storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive instead of maintaining
its own file servers, which can save money on hardware, energy, and
maintenance costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Scalable: Cloud computing is highly scalable, which means that businesses
can easily adjust their computing resources and services to meet changing
demands. With cloud computing, businesses can quickly provision additional
computing resources when they need them and then de-provision them when
they no longer need them. This can be particularly useful for businesses
that experience spikes in demand, such as during peak sales periods or when
launching new products. For example, a business may use a cloud-based
e-commerce platform like Shopify or Magento to quickly scale up its online
store during a busy holiday season.</p></li>
<li><p>Flexible: Cloud computing is highly flexible, which means that businesses
can choose the computing resources and services that best meet their needs.
With cloud computing, businesses can choose from a wide range of computing
resources and services, including storage, processing power, networking,
and more. Additionally, businesses can easily switch between different
cloud providers or services as their needs change. For example, a business
may use a cloud-based email service like Gmail or Outlook instead of
maintaining its own email server, which can provide greater flexibility and
scalability.</p></li>
<li><p>Reliable: Cloud computing is highly reliable, which means that businesses
can expect high levels of uptime and availability. With cloud computing,
businesses can rely on cloud providers to manage and maintain their
computing resources and services, which can help to ensure that they are
always available when needed. Additionally, cloud providers often offer
backup and disaster recovery services, which can help businesses to recover
quickly in the event of a data loss or outage. For example, a business may
use a cloud-based backup service like Backblaze or Carbonite to ensure that
its data is always backed up and protected.</p></li>
<li><p>Secure: Cloud computing is highly secure, which means that businesses can
trust that their data and computing resources are protected from cyber
threats. With cloud computing, businesses can rely on cloud providers to
implement security measures like encryption, firewalls, and access controls
to protect their data and resources. Additionally, cloud providers often
have highly trained security teams that can quickly respond to security
threats or incidents. For example, a business may use a cloud-based
security service like Cloudflare or Akamai to protect its website or online
applications from cyber attacks.</p></li>

<section id="drawbacks-of-cloud-computing">
<h2>Drawbacks of cloud computing<a class="headerlink" href="#drawbacks-of-cloud-computing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Cost: While cloud computing can be cost-effective, it can also be expensive
in many cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Data privacy: When you store your data in the cloud, you are entrusting it
to a third-party provider, which can raise concerns about data privacy and
security.</p></li>
<li><p>Downtime: Cloud computing services can experience downtime, which can disrupt
business operations and cause data loss. Cloud providers typically have
service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee a certain level of uptime, but
downtime can still occur.</p></li>
<li><p>Security concerns: If your data is stored in the cloud, it is vulnerable to
cyber attacks and data breaches. Cloud providers have implemented security
measures to protect your data, but there is always a risk of unauthorized
access or data loss.</p></li>

<h2>Cloud computing service models<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-computing-service-models" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): IaaS is a cloud computing model that
provides businesses with virtualized computing resources, such as virtual
machines, storage, and networking. With IaaS, businesses can easily
provision and manage their own computing infrastructure, without the need
to purchase and maintain physical hardware. Examples of IaaS providers
include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud
Platform (GCP).</p></li>
<li><p>Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS is a cloud computing model that provides
businesses with a platform for developing, deploying, and managing their
own applications. With PaaS, businesses can focus on building and
delivering applications, without the need to manage the underlying
infrastructure. PaaS providers typically provide pre-built tools and
services for application development, such as development frameworks,
databases, and testing tools. Examples of PaaS providers include Heroku,
Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure App Service.</p></li>
<li><p>Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS is a cloud computing model that provides
businesses with access to pre-built software applications that are hosted
in the cloud. With SaaS, businesses can easily access and use software
applications without the need to install or manage the software on their
own devices or servers. SaaS applications can include a wide range of
software, such as customer relationship management (CRM) tools, project
management software, and email services. Examples of SaaS providers include
Salesforce, Dropbox, and Microsoft Office 365.</p></li>
<li><p>Function as a Service (FaaS): FaaS is a cloud computing model that provides
businesses with serverless computing resources, which are used to run
individual functions or pieces of code. With FaaS, businesses can focus on
building and deploying specific functions or services, without the need to
manage the underlying infrastructure. FaaS providers typically charge
businesses based on the number of times their functions are executed or the
amount of time they are executed for. Examples of FaaS providers include
AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Microsoft Azure Functions.</p></li>
