Related Data Structures
=======================
+ C array
+ C string
+ C++ string
+ STL containers: std::vector, std::array, std::list, etc.

Search
======
+ Linear search
+ Binary search
+ Sub-sequence search
+ Variations

  * duplicate elements
  * first/last/all occurrence(s)
  * count

Aggregate Functions
===================
Calculate a single value from a sequence (aggregation). A lot of statistical
functions fall into this category.

+ Count
+ Summation
+ Average
+ Median
+ Mode
+ Standard Deviation

Map/Filter Functions
====================
+ Map: Apply an operation on every element

  * make all elements positive

+ Filter: Keep a subset of elements according to some rule (will be discussed
  in the :doc:`vector chapter </cpp/stl/vector>`)

  * filter negative values
  * filter all odd values

Compare
=======
+ array/string comparison

Simple Sorting Algorithms
=========================
+ selection sort

  Repeatedly select the minimum element from the unsorted part and put it at
  the beginning of the unsorted part. Assuming ascending order.

+ insertion sort

  Elements in the unsorted part are repeatedly inserted to the correct position
  in the sorted part.
