Problem B - Blind Bottles
*************************

You are playing the *Blind Bottles* game. There are *n* bottles, each with a unique
color. The game host arranges them into one row, keeping their ordering a secret.
Your goal is to determine the host's ordering by making guesses. In each guess,
you provide one ordering of the bottles. The host will tell you the number of
bottles in your ordering that are in the correct positions. You win the game
when you make a guess that places all the bottles in their correct positions.

You want to win the game; however, you don’t want to spend all day guessing.
Therefore, you have decided that you’d like to win in at most :math:`10^4`
guesses.

Interaction
===========

This is an interactive problem.

At the start of the input, you will receive a single integer *n*
(:math:`2 \le n \le 100`), the number of bottles. The bottle colors are labeled
with unique integers from 1 to *n*.

After reading this integer, your program should begin making guesses. In each
guess, output a single line of *n* space-separated integers, which is a
permutation of the integers from 1 to *n*. This permutation represents one guess
of the ordering. You will then receive a single integer *k*
(:math:`0 \le k \le n`), which is the number of bottles that are in the correct
positions in your guess. If *k = n*, you have won the game and your program
should terminate. If *k < n*, the game proceeds to the next guess. If you have
not won the game after :math:`10^4` guesses, your program should terminate, and
you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

Do not forget to flush the output after printing each guess. You will not receive
any further input after the game ends—either after you win or after you make
:math:`10^4` guesses.

The judge program is not adversarial, meaning that the ordering of the bottles is
fixed at the start of the game and does not change during the game.
