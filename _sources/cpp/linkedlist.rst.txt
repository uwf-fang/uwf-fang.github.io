**************************
Linked-List Data Structure
**************************
A linked-list is a sequential data structure implemented as linked nodes. Each
node typically contains one or more values and one or more links to neighboring
nodes.

Variations
==========
+ Minimal

  * head pointer only

+ Number of links per node

  * singly-linked - pointer to next node
  * doubly-linked - pointers to previous and next nodes

+ Terminal node handling

  * cyclic - last node point its next pointer to the first node (singly)
  * acyclic

+ Dummy node before the first node

C++ Implementation Details
==========================
+ Classes

  * linked list class

    - pointer to a specific node

  * node class/struct

    - top-level, not nested (preferred in the class)
    - nested (better information hiding)


Pitfalls
========
+ Linked-List is not an ADT. It may implement some ADTs.
