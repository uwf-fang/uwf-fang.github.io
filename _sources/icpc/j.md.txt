# Problem J — Game of Nines

You are playing a simple game of adding digits.
You are given a list of single digits between 0 and 8 (inclusive).

In each move, you may choose any two digits **a** and **b**, add **a** to **b**, and replace **b** with the sum **a + b**.
If **a + b ≥ 10**, keep only the units digit (e.g., 5 + 8 becomes 3; 4 + 6 becomes 0).

Whenever the sum is **9**, the result is eliminated immediately and cannot participate in further additions.
Note that you cannot add a digit to itself, but you **may** choose two digits **a** and **b** that have the same value.

Your goal is to eliminate as many digits as possible, using any number of moves.


## Input

The first line of input contains a single integer **n** (**2 ≤ n ≤ 1000**),
the number of digits.

Each of the next **n** lines contains a single digit between **0** and **8**,
forming the initial list of digits.


## Output

Output a single integer —
the **minimum number of digits** that will remain if you play optimally to eliminate as many digits as possible.


## Explanation of Sample Case 1

Add **3** to **6** and eliminate one digit (3 + 6 becomes 9).
The remaining digits are **2** and **3**.

Then add **2** to **3** three times:

* 3 + 2 → 5
* 5 + 2 → 7
* 7 + 2 → 9 (eliminated)

The single digit remaining is **2**.
It is also possible to eliminate two digits with a different sequence of moves.
