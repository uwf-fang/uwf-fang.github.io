Streaming for Big Data
**********************
Definition of data streaming
============================
Streaming for Big Data is a method of processing and analyzing large and
complex data sets in real-time or near real-time. It involves a continuous
flow of data that can be analyzed, processed, and acted upon in real-time as
it is generated. The importance of streaming for Big Data lies in the fact
that traditional data processing methods are not efficient in dealing with
large and continuously generated data sets.

Real-time requirements
======================
Streaming is useful only when the data needs to be processed in real-time.
Real-time here means that the result of the processing is required within a
few milliseconds or seconds. For example, in the case of stock trading, the
data needs to be processed in real-time to make quick decisions. In the case
of fraud detection, the data needs to be processed in real-time to detect and
prevent fraudulent activities. In the case of IoT devices, the data needs to
be processed in real-time to monitor and control the devices.

**Applications that allows for a delay in processing the data, for example, a
few hours or days, do not require streaming.** For example, in the case of
analyzing customer behavior, the data can be processed in batches, for example,
once a day, and the result can be used to make decisions for the next day.

**Streaming should be only added to the pipeline when the needs justify the
cost!** For example, in any data application that can perform well with
historical data (a couple of hours or days old, for example), streaming is not
necessary. In applications where real-time data is required, for example, fraud
detection, stock trading, etc., streaming is a must.

Characteristics
===============
* Real-time: Streaming for Big Data allows organizations to process data in
  real-time, which means they can act on data insights as they occur. This is
  particularly useful for time-sensitive data, such as financial transactions
  or sensor data from IoT devices.
* Continuous: Streaming for Big Data involves a continuous flow of data that
  can be processed and analyzed without interruption. This means that
  organizations can receive and process data in real-time, without having to
  wait for batch processing. The continuous processing enables organizations
  to quickly and effectively respond to changing conditions.
* Heterogeneous: Data streams involves data that is heterogeneous, meaning it
  can come from different sources and in various formats. It can include
  structured data from traditional databases, as well as unstructured data
  from social media feeds, sensor data from IoT devices, and more. This
  requires organizations to use advanced analytics techniques to clean,
  normalize, and process the data to extract meaningful insights.
* Imperfect: Data streams are often imperfect, meaning it can contain errors,
  inconsistencies, or missing values. This requires organizations to use
  advanced data quality techniques to identify and fix issues in real-time.
  By doing so, they can avoid making decisions based on inaccurate or
  incomplete data.
* Volatile: In the context of streaming for big data, "volatile" refers to
  the rapid and unpredictable rate of change of data. This characteristic is
  particularly relevant for data that is continuously flowing in real-time
  from various sources, such as sensors, social media feeds, and other
  streaming data.

  Organizations must understand the volatility of streaming data to determine
  how long it remains relevant and actionable. For instance, sentiment
  analysis of social media data can be highly volatile, as opinions can
  quickly shift and change. Conversely, certain types of streaming data, such
  as weather trends, may have a lower volatility as they are more
  predictable.

  Understanding the volatility of streaming data is crucial for effective
  data management and analysis. Organizations need to implement real-time
  analytics tools and techniques that can rapidly process and analyze the
  data as it streams in. Failure to properly manage volatile data in
  real-time can lead to inaccurate insights, missed opportunities, and
  increased business risks.

Advantages of Streaming
=======================
* Real-time: Real-time processing is a critical advantage of data streaming
  technology in big data applications. Real-time processing allows
  organizations to analyze and process data as it is generated, providing
  immediate insights and enabling timely decision-making. With data streaming
  technology, data can be analyzed and acted upon within milliseconds or
  seconds, which is particularly important in industries such as finance,
  healthcare, and transportation where real-time decision-making is critical.

  One of the key benefits of real-time processing is the ability to detect
  and respond to events as they happen. For example, in the financial
  industry, real-time processing can be used to detect fraudulent activities
  as they occur, preventing financial losses and maintaining customer trust.
  In healthcare, real-time processing can be used to monitor patients' vital
  signs, alerting doctors immediately if there are any signs of trouble. In
  transportation, real-time processing can be used to track the location of
  vehicles, predict traffic patterns, and optimize routes in real-time,
  improving efficiency and reducing costs. Real-time processing also enables
  organizations to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. For
  example, real-time analysis of customer behavior can provide insights into
  customer preferences and enable organizations to personalize marketing
  messages in real-time, increasing the likelihood of conversion and
  improving customer satisfaction.

* Scalability is a key advantage of data streaming technology in big data
  applications. Data streaming technology can handle large volumes of data
  and scale easily to meet increasing data processing demands. As data
  volumes grow, data streaming technology can dynamically allocate more
  resources to handle the increased workload, ensuring that processing
  remains efficient and effective.

  One of the key reasons why data streaming technology is so scalable is its
  ability to process data in parallel. Data is broken down into small chunks
  and processed concurrently, which allows for higher throughput and reduced
  processing times. This parallel processing also allows for horizontal
  scaling, where additional computing resources can be added to the
  processing pipeline to handle increasing data volumes.

* Flexibility: Data streaming technology is highly flexible and can be used
  in a variety of applications. It can be used for real-time monitoring,
  predictive analytics, fraud detection, and more. Data streaming technology
  is not limited to any specific type of data, and it can process data in
  many formats, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
  This flexibility allows for organizations to use data streaming technology
  for a wide range of use cases, such as financial services, healthcare,
  retail, manufacturing, and more.

  For example, in financial services, data streaming technology can be used
  for real-time monitoring of transactions to detect fraudulent activities.
  In healthcare, data streaming technology can be used to monitor patients'
  vital signs in real-time, providing doctors with instant alerts if any
  vital signs fall outside of acceptable ranges. In retail, data streaming
  technology can be used for real-time inventory management, ensuring that
  products are always available on the shelves.

* Reduced storage and processing costs:

  Reduced storage and processing costs are an important advantage of data
  streaming technology in big data applications. Traditional batch processing
  methods require large amounts of storage and processing power, which can be
  expensive and time-consuming. Data streaming technology, on the other hand,
  can significantly reduce storage and processing costs by processing data in
  real-time and discarding data that is no longer needed.

  With data streaming technology, data is processed as it is generated and
  analyzed in real-time. This means that data does not need to be stored in
  large quantities before processing, which can significantly reduce storage
  costs. In addition, since data is processed in real-time, processing
  resources can be allocated more efficiently, reducing processing costs.

Drawbacks of Streaming
======================
* Higher costs: Data streaming technology can be more expensive than other
  data processing methods, such as batch processing. Data streaming
  technology requires specialized skills and expertise, which can be
  difficult to find and expensive to acquire. In addition, data streaming
  technology often requires the use of multiple tools and technologies, which
  can increase the cost of the data processing pipeline.
* Data quality issues: Data streaming technology can lead to data quality
  issues, such as missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data.
  This is because data is processed in real-time, which means that there is
  no time to clean and normalize the data before processing. This can lead to
  inaccurate insights and decisions, which can have a negative impact on
  business operations.
* No backup of historical data and intermediate data.
* More complexity: Data streaming technology is more complex than traditional
  batch processing methods, which can make it difficult for organizations to
  implement and maintain. Data streaming technology requires specialized
  skills and expertise, which can be difficult to find and expensive to
  acquire. In addition, data streaming technology often requires the use of
  multiple tools and technologies, which can increase the complexity of the
  data processing pipeline.
