Dijkstra's shortest path
************************
Among the many variations of the shortest path algorithms, single-source
shortest path algorithm is most commonly discussed. The objective is to find
the shortest path of all other vertices to given a vertex (source). Shortest
path problem with unweighted graph can be solved using BFS. Dijkstra's approach
works with weighted (non-negative weight) graph. See `visualization`__
