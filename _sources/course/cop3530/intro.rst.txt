*******************************************************
Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures I Course
*******************************************************

This course is the first of a two-course sequence on algorithms and data
structures. It is designed to provide students with a solid foundation in the
design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms and data structures.

Students are expect to have a good understanding of the C++ programming
language and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms before starting
this course.

What should be known before taking this course
==============================================
The following are covered in the prerequisite courses at UWF. If any of these
are not familiar, please review them briefly before taking this course or when
needed. You are not expected to memorize all details of these topics, but you
should have a good understanding of them and how to pick up the details when
needed. I will revisit some of them in this course as needed.

+ Development environment

  * Local computer

    - Windows system for Linux (WSL)
    - Linux native
    - Mac OS native

  * Remote

    - SSH server (Linux)

+ C++ building process

  * g++ compiler

    - 3 stages of compilation
    - cpp or object files as arguments
    - ``-c`` option to enable step-wise compilation
    - other options

  * Makefile

    - three parts of a rule: target, prerequisites, and recipe
    - trigger a rule using ``make target`` command

  * Modular programming

    - header file

      + include directive
      + header guards

    - cpp file
    - modular units

      + module (hpp/cpp pair)
      + driver (cpp only)

+ C++ language features

  * type

    - primitive: int, float, double, char, bool
    - derived: array, pointer, reference
    - class (user-defined)

  * variable

    - declaration
    - initialization
    - assignment
    - scope

  * expressions

    - operators
    - precedence
    - associativity

  * flow of control

    - sequential
    - conditional

      + if-else
      + switch

    - loop

      + while
      + do-while
      + for

  * functions

    - three types of syntax: declaration, definition, and call
    - details

      + return type
      + return statement
      + formal parameters
      + actual parameters
      + default values

    - parameter passing

      + by value
      + by reference
      + by pointer (special case of by value)

    - function overloading

      + same name but different parameter list

        * return type does not matter
        * formal parameter name does not matter
        * parameter type, number, and order matter

    - parameter matching mechanism

      + two level of matching

        * exact match
        * matching with implicit conversion

  * class

    - class declaration syntax

      + sections (public, private)
      + instance variables
      + method declaration
      + in-line method definition

    - method definition syntax

      + scope resolution operator \:\:
      + this pointer

    - special methods

      + constructors

        * default constructor
        * parameterized constructor

      + destructor

    - usage

      + as a data type
      + instance/object declaration
      + constructor triggering during declaration
      + ownership

        * dot \. for object owners
        * arrow -\> for pointer to object owners

  * memory management

    - four regions
    - memory leak
    - dynamic data

      + pointer-typed variable
      + new / new []
      + delete / delete []

  * Input/output (I/O)

    - standard I/O
    - file streams
    - string streams (as formatting tool, better than string concatenation)
    - operations

      + insertion operator <<
      + extraction operator >>
      + getline (special handling when used after >>)

    - stream manipulators

      + endl
      + setw
      + setprecision
      + fixed
      + left
      + right

+ basic algorithms

  * searching

    - linear search
    - binary search (sorted array only)

  * sorting

    - selection sort
    - insertion sort

+ basics of design

  * top-down design
  * object oriented design

+ basics of std::vector
