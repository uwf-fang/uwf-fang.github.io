Compilation Using g++
*********************

Compilation is a process to translate source codes into executables or
libraries. A compiled programming language requires source codes to be compiled
before they can be executed. C++ is typical compiled programming language.

Mainstream Compilation Systems
==============================
There are many mainstream C/C++ compilers available to various operating
systems:

+ Cross-platform (Linux native, Mac OS, Windows, etc.): gcc/g++ from GNU GCC
+ Mac OS native: The LLVM C/C++ compilers clang/clang++ from the Xcode
  command-line tools
+ Windows native: Visual C++

They are not compatible to each other so you need to stick to one for
consistency. **In our course, the GNU g++ (part of GCC) is chosen as the only
compiler and you must stick to it so your code can be correctly compile and
executed by your instructor or grader.**

Stages of compilation of C/C++ projects
=======================================
General compilation process of C/C++ projects contains three main stages:
preprocessing, compilation, and linking.

.. glossary::

  Preprocessing step
    Process preprocessing directives like #include, #define, etc. Performs
    textual manipulations mostly.

  Compilation step
    Translate the source code (.cpp) files to object (.o) files.

  Linking step
    Link object (.o) files to produce an executables (or a library)

The three steps can be performed all at once or separately using g++. The
preprocessing step are usually performed together the compilation step. Thus,
typical step-wise compilations involve two steps: Preprocessing+Compilation and
Linking.

The g++ command
===============
g++ is the GNU C++ compiler invocation command. It builds C++ source codes to
produce libraries or executables.

g++ command-line
----------------
A typical g++ compilation command-line looks like:

.. code-block:: bash

  g++ <options> <arguments>

.. glossary::

  g++ options
    Something started with a hyphen character. They are provided to control the
    behavior of the compilation. Some options come with their own arguments.

  g++ arguments
    Everything in the command-line that are not options. They usually specify
    the source of the compilation. They can be either .cpp file or .o file
    names.

Example: :code:`g++ -Wall -std=c++14 -Wall -o main main.cpp`

Common g++ options
------------------

.. glossary::

  -o
    This option specify the name of the output file. It must be followed by a
    name. For example, ``-o main`` to generate a file called ``main``.

  -c
    This option tell g++ to compile only. No linking. It will generate an
    object file.

  -std=c++14
    Use the C++ standard 14 to compile. There are other C++ standards available
    such as C++ 11, C++ 17, C++20, etc.

  -Wall
    Show common warning messages. Many warning messages are helpful to give you
    hints on potential problem in your code.

  -g
    Store debugging information during compilation to allow future use of
    debuggers like ``gdb`` or ``valgrind``.

Preprocessor directives
=======================
Preprocessor directives are instructions used in your source code. They are
mixed with C++ statements and direct how the preprocessor will manipulate the
text of the source codes files before they are actually compiled. They are
instructions started with a hash symbol ``#``.

.. warning::

  Preprocessor directives are not statements and no semicolons are needed as
  the termination of directives. They are line based instead.

+ ``#include``

  It is used to copy and paste texts from another file to the location of the
  directive. You can use either angular brackets ``<>`` or double quotation marks ``""`` to include system headers or user headers:

  .. code-block:: c++

    // user header
    #include "mylib.hpp"
    // system header
    #include <iostream>

  .. note::

    The order of inclusion matters and it is recommended to to start from local
    headers to system headers. Refer to the best practices documents for more
    details.

+ ``#define``

  It is used to define macros. Un-parameterized macros without values are
  preprocessor only flags. Un-parameterized macros with values can be used
  like a text replacement token or a constant. Parameterized macros work like
  functions. It is not preferred in the courses! Use functions instead!

  .. code-block:: c++

    // preprocessor only flags
    #define HEADER_HPP
    // constant like macro
    #define PI 3.14159

+ conditional compilation ``#if``, ``#elif``, ``#else``, ``#ifdef``,
  ``#ifndef``, ``#endif``

  They can be used to direct the preprocessor to include code blocks
  conditionally. These directives may greatly improve efficiency of the
  compilation process in large projects in trade of the readability and thus
  maintainability. In our course, we only use them in header guards.

+ Header guards

  **Header guards** are the preferred way to prevent header contents from being
  included more than once. It is preferred over the alternative way using
  ``#progma once``, which is a non-standard C++ directive.

  .. code-block:: c++

    #ifndef MYHEADER_HPP
    #define MYHEADER_HPP

    // header contents

    #endif // MYHEADER_HPP

  .. warning::

    You must add header guards to all user headers!

Styles of compilation
=====================
One step compilation
--------------------
You may use a single g++ command to produce the executable from the source code
files. In this method, all three tasks are performed in one step.

You can list all cpp files in the command line as arguments and specify the
output file name as main::

  g++ -std=c++14 -o main main.cpp lib1.cpp lib2.cpp

You may also use wildcard to match all cpp files if only one cpp file contains
a main function::

  g++ -std=c++14 -o main *.cpp

.. note::

  It will fail if you have multiple main functions in your cpp files.

Modular compilation
-------------------
In the modular compilation approach, the compilation(include the preprocessing
step) and linking steps are performed separately to provide fine control over
arguments and fine grained error handling.

Use the same example with a ``main.cpp``, a ``lib1.cpp``, and a ``lib2.cpp``
with several headers. You can build your ``main`` executable in steps::

  g++ -std=c++14 -Wall -c main.cpp
  g++ -std=c++14 -Wall -c lib1.cpp
  g++ -std=c++14 -Wall -c lib2.cpp
  g++ -o main main.o lib1.o lib2.o

The first three lines compiles all source code files to the corresponding
object files respectively. The last line links all object files into an
executable named ``main``.

.. warning::

  **Modular compilation is always preferred as every step may trigger errors
  and they are much easier to fix separately** It is complicated but can be
  automated using building tools such as GNU make, etc.

Pitfalls
--------

+ include header files in the g++ command

::

  g++ -o main main.cpp lib1.hpp lib1.cpp

Common Error Messages From g++
------------------------------

.. note::

  Some error messages are misleading. Thus, do not stick to it if you cannot
  figure it out. Try other method such as code review to solve the problem
  instead.

+ Alway solve only one error message and re-compile to see the result
+ Compilation errors

  Error happens during compilation of .cpp files to .o files.

  * :code:`undeclared identifier ...`

    - Means that the compiler cannot find a matching declaration for an
      identifier usage
    - Misspelled identifier (variable name, type name, class name, etc) when
      you declare or use an identifier
    - Forget to include the header that declared the identifier

  * :code:`No matching function ...`

    - Means that the compiler cannot find a matching declaration for a
      function call
    - Misspelled function name when you declare or call a function
    - Forget to include the header that declared the function

+ Linker errors

  Error happens during the linking of .o files to an executable. They usually
  end with :code:`ld returned 1 exit status` in the last line.

  * :code:`undefined reference to ...`

    - Means that the linker cannot find a function definition for a given
      declaration
    - misspelled function name when you declare or define a function
    - Forget to include the .o file where the function definition is

  * :code:`multiple definition of ... first defined here`

    - Means that you have multiple function definitions with a same name and
      parameter list
    - You have included a wrong .o file in the g++ command. For example, two .o
      file each has a main function.
    - A failed function overloading
    - A misspelled function name in the definition so it conflict with another
      function
