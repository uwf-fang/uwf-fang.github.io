********
C String
********

The C string data structure is outdated. It is hard and insecure to use. C++
string is recommended to be used almost all the time.

+ A partially filed char array with a '\0' (null) char to mark the end
+ not a class type. no methods!
+ [] syntax

  * no out-of-range check

+ Example:

  * ``char str1[100] = "abc"``

    - The C string can hold 99 characters without overflowing
    - The string length is 3 (not include the tailing '\0')
    - The spaces filled is 4 (include the tailing '\0')

  * ``char str1[] = "abc"``

    - The string length is 3
    - The array length is 4 (include the tailing '\0')
    - The array is all filled

+ Pitfalls

  * ``cout << myString.size();`` C string has no method at all
  * ``char str1[10] = {0}; cout << str1[10];`` out-of-range access
  * ``char str2[3] = "abc";`` overflows, the str2 can have at most two chars

+ C string functions

  * cstring header
  * strcpy()
  * strncpy()
  * strcat()
  * strncat()
  * strchar()
  * strlen()
  * strcmp()

+ char functions

  * cctype header (not typo, two c)
  * isalpha()
  * isdigit()
  * isspace()
  * islower()
  * isupper()
  * toupper()
  * tolower()
