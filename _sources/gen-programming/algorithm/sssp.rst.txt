Single Source Shortest Path Algorithms
=======================================
Single source shortest path algorithms are essential techniques in graph theory
and computer science used to find the shortest path from a single source vertex
to all other vertices in a weighted graph. They have widespread applications in
various domains, such as network routing, GPS navigation, and optimization
problems.

+ Single source to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all
  other vertices in a weighted graph
+ All pairs to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a
  weighted graph
+ Applications

  + Network routing
  + GPS navigation
  + Optimization problems

Dijkstra's Algorithm
---------------------

Dijkstra's algorithm is a widely-used algorithm to find the shortest path from
a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It works by
iteratively selecting the vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the
source and relaxing its neighboring vertices.

Pseudo-code for Dijkstra's Algorithm
------------------------------------

.. code-block::
  :caption: Dijkstra's Algorithm

  function dijkstra(graph, source):
    create a priority queue Q
    initialize distances to all vertices as infinity
    set the distance to the source as 0

    while Q is not empty:
      current_vertex = vertex with the smallest distance in Q
      remove current_vertex from Q

      for each neighbor of current_vertex:
        edge_weight = weight of the edge between current_vertex and neighbor
        tentative_distance = distance to current_vertex + edge_weight
        if tentative_distance < distance to neighbor:
          set distance to neighbor as tentative_distance
          add neighbor to Q
