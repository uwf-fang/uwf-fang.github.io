**************
Testing in C++
**************

As the size and complexity of a software project scales, manual testing and
debugging become less and less effective. A more systematic testing method is
desirable.

The modular development of large projects breaks codes into smaller modules and
units such as functions, and classes. Within in this context, Unit Testing and
Integration Testing are extremely effective. Both of them are designed to be
automated with the help of testing frameworks. It is a huge boost to the
quality of the produced codes.

.. glossary::

  Unit test
    It is a type of testing strategy to test software units individually in
    isolation. To ensure *isolation*, techniques like mocking, stubbing, and
    faking are introduced.

  Integration test
    It is a type of testing strategy to test how a group of units works
    together. Isolation can also be reinforced, similar to unit testing.

  Acceptance test
    It is a final integration test that runs the whole software system all
    together.

  Testing framework
    A library/software to facilitate the testing process.

Simple Test Run
===============

As a beginner taking entry-level courses, you should learn testing as soon as
possible to build a correct workflow on project. You can start writing tests by
simply add ``cout`` and ``if`` statements to check whether your function or
class is doing its job as expected. These codes can be kept in separate cpp
files with its own main function or as functions in your driver file, such as
main.cpp.

For example, assume that we have two classes ``StoreItem`` and ``Store`` to
test. A test driver may look like this:

.. literalinclude:: test-driver.cpp
  :caption: test-driver.cpp
  :language: cpp
  :linenos:

Assertions
==========

The ``assert`` macro function (similar to a function when used) allows a more
efficient way to run tests. This macro takes a bool parameter and abort your
program when the bool expression evaluates to false. You can add as many as you
like in your program during debugging and disable all of them by adding a line
of ``#define NDEBUG`` before the ``#include <cassert>`` directive.

Testing Frameworks
==================

Choosing a good testing framework is more effective in terms of easier test
writing and creation, better test organization, and better test result
presentations. We choose the Catch2 framework to write tests in some projects.
It is simple but feature-rich. The syntax to write tests are simple:

.. literalinclude:: test-catch.cpp
  :caption: test-catch.cpp
  :language: cpp
  :linenos:


The ``TEST_CASE`` macro defines a test case with a description and a tag
string. The ``REQUIRE`` macro will check the condition in the parenthesis. It
will pass if the condition is true. The whole testing process will be aborted
on false. Replace ``REQUIRE`` with ``CHECK`` if you want the testing process to
continue on false. Thus, ``REQUIRE`` behaves like ``assert`` and is good for
debugging so we can focus on the first error. On the contrast, ``CHECK`` is
good for summarizing or grading when the overall passing rate is important. You
will see ``CHECK`` in the testing cases in our projects rather than
``REQUIRE``.

Testability
===========

Some codes are easier to test than others. In most of the cases, a more
testable code base has better quality than something not very testable.
Testable codes are usually well-designed.

There are many principles in how to write testable codes. Here are some simple
rules we can follow:

#. keep the size of each unit small
#. keep each unit coherent
#. keep each unit focusing on one responsibility
#. keep the units decoupled (each unit *knows* minimal numbers of other units)
#. keep units deterministic (same inputs always give the same results)
#. keep most units side effect free if possible
