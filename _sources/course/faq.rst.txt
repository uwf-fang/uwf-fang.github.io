Course
======

How are programming courses different from other courses?
---------------------------------------------------------

#. It is progressive. It means that later contents depends on earlier contents.
   **It is extremely risky if you are behind and fail to catch up in the
   semester!** Try to distribute your time evenly in the semester. Catch up
   immediately if you are interrupted by something and feel yourself being
   behind.
#. It depends heavily on hands-on experience. Experimenting with code is always
   the the best way to learn in programming courses.
#. There will always be new contents to learn. Knowing what to focus is
   important. Some core contents must be mastered while some details just need
   some brief knowledge. Knowing "why" is more efficient than knowing "what" and
   "how".

Course Materials
================

Why should you take notes even when course notes are provided?
--------------------------------------------------------------

It is because note taking is an important process for you to learn. Finding the
topics that are most confusing to you or may cause mistakes in the future is the
best way to learn. The instructor will point out many confusing topics, pitfalls
and most "testable" details in class and in official course notes and you should
decide what applies to you and write them down with our own interpretation.
General course notes are for everyone, you own note will always serve yourself
better.

How to get most out of the code samples?
----------------------------------------

Programmers "write" code rather than "read" code. Code examples are your for
just reading. You must play with it in your editor. The best way to use the code
samples is to run, modify, and experiment with them.

Shall I read external materials?
--------------------------------

External materials are always encouraged. Because there are so many details that
cannot be covered in the book and notes, whenever needed, you should search in
external sources. External sources include the course materials from the
prerequisite courses, primer chapters in the textbook, reference books/websites,
Q&A websites (StackOverflow, Quora, etc.) and of course search engines.

Should I look for external code samples to practice my programming skill?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is recommended only when you finished all provided course materials and want
to further improve yourself. The fact is that C++ is such a broad topic and most
external examples you can find have some gap with the contents covered in the
class. You will encounter topics not covered in the class or non-standard coding
features not used in the class. This is the reason that you should focus on the
provided materials first.

Communication
=============

What is the best way to keep updated?
-------------------------------------

**First of all, attending the class!**

Make use of the communication tools:

+ Canvas Notification System
+ Canvas Calendar
+ Discord Server
+ Email

More details about communication can be found on Canvas.

What communication tools to avoid?
----------------------------------
Avoid Navigation messages and Canvas messages. They are easy to miss!

What is the best communication tools in certain use cases?
----------------------------------------------------------

**Questions sharable to classmates**
  Discord server

**Questions containing personal code or questions**
  Discord Server Direct Message or Email



How can I find help!
--------------------

For general questions, read the FAQ first to see if your question is answered
here. You may always contact your instructor and TA for help. General course
related questions can be asked and discussed on the Discord server and more
personalized question can be asked through email. Avoid the Canvas and Navigate
messaging systems, they are hard to monitor and will cause delay in response.

Grading
=======

How can I calculate my final grade accurately
---------------------------------------------

At the end of the semester when all assignment and quiz grades are posted, you
can trust the final grade calculated on Canvas. Before that, You can manually
calculate your final grade according to the grading scheme posted both on the
course homepage on Canvas and in the syllabus.

What grade to expect for each category of assessments?
------------------------------------------------------

It is hard but possible to target for close to 100% in the closed-book quizzes
and exams.

It is not too hard to target for 100% in all other types of assessments as long
as you put a reasonable amount of effort in. You can start early and find help
for challenging assignments like programming projects.

Can I appeal a grade if I find issues or mistakes?
--------------------------------------------------

Of course you can! Instructors and graders are all human that may make mistake.
Please do it within a week after the grades are posted. There will be many
administrative problems to change grades late.

Why the zyBooks related grades are not appearing on Canvas?
-----------------------------------------------------------

To avoid synchronization problem, the zyBooks related grades in my courses are
collected manually during the designated deadline. The grades will be updated
before the final grade calculation.

Exams
=====

What is the most efficient way to prepare for an exam?
------------------------------------------------------

Efficient students usually distribute their time evenly in the semester. They
try to understand the contents delivered in class right away rather than going
over everything in the last week or even weekend before the exam.

What materials will be relevant in the exam preparation?
--------------------------------------------------------

There will be practice exams and review outlines provided specifically for exam
preparation. You should use them together with other course materials though.

The suggested priority of materials are:

#. Practice exams
#. Past exams
#. Review outlines
#. Course notes
#. Code examples

The **ZyBook** should be referred to whenever needed when using other materials.
External materials are usually not necessary if you can make good use of the
provided materials. They can be useful when you are looking for answers of
specific questions.

When will the exam be given? Where can I find the exam times?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Midterms will be given during the second class meeting in the exam week. The
final exam schedule will follow the general `final exam schedule`_ according to
the class meeting time.

.. _final exam schedule: https://confluence.uwf.edu/display/public/Final+Exam+Schedule

The exam times will also be posted as events in the Canvas calendar. Make sure
that you will check it frequently.

Are all exams closed-book?
--------------------------

Yes, they are! You are only allowed to use blank sheets of papers. A standard
calculator will be provided as part of the lock-down browser or Honorlock
plugin.

How are exams given?
--------------------

The exams are given as Canvas quizzes. For exams given in class, you will be
asked to use the lock-down browser or honorlock. For exams given online,
proctoring tools like Respondus Monitor or Honorlock proctoring service are
required.

How to handle tech issues during exams?
---------------------------------------

For exams given in class, the instructor or other proctors will help you. For
exams given online, it is your responsibility to test your computer and devices
beforehand to minimize the possibility of tech problems. Never try to take an
online exam under unsecure environment with slow/unstable internet connection or
potential interruptions. You can choose to take the exam in class or at the `UWF
testing center`__ if you have problem finding a secure testing environment.

Can I reschedule my exam because of a time conflict?
----------------------------------------------------

Generally no! The midterms are given during class meeting times and you should
not register the class if you have time conflict with the class meeting time.
The final exam schedules are know from the beginning of the semester and you
should have plenty of time to arrange your time! They can also be found on the
Canvas calendar. Reasons like you do not know the exam time until the last
minute are not acceptable and you will not get a second chance to take the exam.

If you really cannot make it due to an emergency or unavoidable circumstances,
contact your instructor as early as possible.

How are special accommodations for exam handled?
------------------------------------------------

You must have the official approval first. Let the instructor know your plan
before the exam if there will be special setup of the exam needed.

.. _proj-faq:

Project
=======

Are projects all about coding?
------------------------------

No, they are more than just coding. Projects are designed to let student
practice their problem solving skills. It include many aspects besides coding:

#. Problem comprehension
#. Design
#. Coding
#. Testing
#. Clean-up and submission

All steps are important and coding is just a small portion of the whole project.

How are projects graded?
------------------------

The instructor/grader will typically download/collect your submission. Put it in
an environment compatible to the SSH server (Linux). Build it using make or g++
in the command-line interface. Run and test the functionality. Anything not
compilable in the environment will be considered as "uncompilable" and you will
lose all points related to both building/compilation and functionalities.
**An uncompilable project will give you < 30% of grade even though you have
written hundreds of lines of code.**

Can I get partial credit on code that does not run?
---------------------------------------------------

Code entities like classes, methods or functions are graded only when they are
executed when your program runs. For complex projects, all functionalities are
tested by running your code. The grader has no responsibility to read your code
and grade based on that. Thus, **do not expect partial credit if your code
cannot be tested because your project does not compile or the code entities like
classes or functions are never invoked in your program.**

What is the late policy?
------------------------
There will be a three-day grace period after the due date of all project. Late
projects will be penalized by the deductions of 10 pts, 20 pts, and 40 pts out
of a 100 pts project grade for projects that are 1, 2 and 3 days late. Any
submission after the grace period are not accepted as the solution are usually
posted after that.

How are plagiarisms checked in projects?
----------------------------------------

As a type of assignments that can be copied easily, code duplication in
programming projects will be periodically checked using professional tools like
MOSS. These tools will check for duplicate logics ignoring changes of names and
orders. You will get a zero if the code duplication is identified. Thus, do not
share finished work or large code units with other students or copy/steal from
other students as well as any other online resources. Sharing of small reusable
code snippets like patterns taught in the class are allowed.
