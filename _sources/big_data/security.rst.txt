Security and Privacy for Big Data
*********************************
Threats and risks in Big Data
=============================

Big Data is a term used to describe the massive amounts of data generated by
individuals, organizations, and machines. Big data poses several security and
privacy risks that organizations need to consider, such as:

* Unauthorized access: The sheer volume of data in big data environments
  makes it difficult to secure every single data point, making them more
  vulnerable to hacking and unauthorized access.
* Malicious attacks: Big data can be a prime target for malicious actors
  looking to steal sensitive data, compromise systems, or cause harm to an
  organization.
* Insider threats: Employees or contractors with access to big data can
  intentionally or unintentionally disclose confidential data, compromising
  security and privacy.
* Compliance violations: If an organization fails to comply with relevant
  laws and regulations, it may face legal action, penalties, and loss of
  reputation.

Data security and privacy techniques
====================================

* Authentication and access control

  Authentication and access control are critical for securing cloud computing
  environments. They involve the use of passwords, multi-factor
  authentication, biometric authentication, and access control lists to limit
  access to sensitive data.

* Encryption and data masking

  Encryption is a technique used to protect sensitive data by converting it
  into a coded language that can only be accessed with a decryption key. Data
  masking is another technique used to protect sensitive data by replacing
  the original data with fake or obfuscated data.

* Data backup and disaster recovery

  Data backup and disaster recovery are essential components of any cloud
  computing environment. These measures help ensure that data can be
  recovered in the event of a system failure, natural disaster, or cyber
  attack.

Laws and regulations
====================
Several laws and regulations govern data security and privacy in cloud
computing environments. Some of the most significant ones include:

* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

  The GDPR is a European Union (EU) regulation that came into effect in 2018.
  It governs the processing, storage, and protection of personal data in the
  EU and aims to provide EU citizens with greater control over their personal
  data.

* Related US federal laws and acts

  US do not have a single federal law that governs data security and privacy.
  Instead, there are several federal laws and acts that govern data security
  and privacy in the US, including:

  - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

    HIPAA is a federal law in the United States that was enacted in 1996. It
    sets standards for the privacy and security of health information,
    including electronic health records. HIPAA applies to healthcare
    providers, insurance companies, and other entities that handle protected
    health information. The law requires these entities to safeguard
    patients' personal and health information and to notify them if there is
    a breach of their information.

  - Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

    FERPA is a federal law in the United States that protects the privacy of
    student education records. FERPA applies to schools that receive federal
    funding, including K-12 schools and colleges and universities. The law
    gives parents and students the right to access and review their education
    records, and it requires schools to obtain written consent before
    disclosing any personally identifiable information in these records.

  - The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)

    The FCRA is is a federal law in the United States that regulates the
    collection, dissemination, and use of consumer credit information. FCRA
    applies to consumer reporting agencies, lenders, and other entities that
    use credit information. The law requires these entities to ensure the
    accuracy and privacy of consumer credit information and to obtain written
    consent before accessing or sharing this information.

  - Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA)

    The FTCA is a federal law that governs the processing, storage, and
    protection of personal information in the US. It came into effect in 1946
    and aims to protect the privacy of individuals' personal information.

* State laws and acts

  - California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

    The CCPA is a state-level law in California that governs the collection,
    storage, and use of personal data. It came into effect in 2020 and
    provides California residents with the right to know what data is being
    collected about them, the right to delete their data, and the right to
    opt-out of data sharing.
