Midterm Topic Outline
*********************
Because midterm is a take-home quiz, nothing to prepare really. You can use
this document as a guide to the reviewing of the book content. You may also use
use this outline as a quick reference to find where to locate the book sections
when working with on the midterm.


Types of Questions
