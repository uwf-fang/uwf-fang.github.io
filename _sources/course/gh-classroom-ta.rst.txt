Instructions For GitHub Classroom Grading
*****************************************
This instruction is designed for TA to grade the assignments collected in
GitHub Classrooms.

Prerequisite
============
You will need to have a GitHub account and be added as a TA to the GitHub
Classroom. Simply share your GitHub account with your instructor to be invited.

Autograding
===========
In most of the cases, the assignments are autograded. You can either download
the grade as a CSV file or view the grade on GitHub Classroom. The grades need
to be manually added to Canvas. You can use the SpeedGrader and Canvas Rubric
to grade the assignments.

Manual Grading
==============
In the case that the assignment is not or is partially autograded, you will
need to manually grade the assignment. To download the student submission,
check the green button on the right side of the assignment page. Currently, the
only way to download the student submission is to use GitHub CLI.

+ Official `documentation on GH CLI <ghcli_>`_.
