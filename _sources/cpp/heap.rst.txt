******************
Heap and Heap Sort
******************

Heap
====
+ Definition

  A complete binary tree in which parent node is always less/greater (min/max
  heap) or equal (if allow overlapped values) than its children

+ Logically a complete tree
+ physically an array

  * find parent/children by arithmetic calculation of indices

+ type

  * max heap
  * min heap

+ behaviors

  * insert

    - insert at the end
    - swap with its parent if it violate the rule (percolate up)
    - keep checking all ancestors till the root is reached

  * remove

    - remove the root by overwriting it using the last element
    - swap the parent node with its least/greatest child starting from the root
      until the leaf node is reached (percolate down)

  * percolate up/down

    - move one element up/down in an existing heap

Heap sort
=========
+ removing the root node repeatedly from a heap
+ heapify the array (turn randomly ordered array into a heap)

  * percolate repeatedly

Priority queue
--------------

* Not really a queue or stack because not first in first out
* any in min/max out
* behaviors same as queue or stack

  - push
  - pop
  - peek
  - isEmpty
  - getLength
