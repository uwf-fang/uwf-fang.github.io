C++ programming language
************************

A high-level compiled, typed, object-oriented, class-based, and general purpose
programming language.

Naming convention required in class
===================================

We use a common naming convention in the class:

:Type, and class names: UpperCamelCase (Pascal case)
:Function, variable names: lowerCamelCase
:Constant and Macro names: ALL_UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE
:Header file extension: hpp
:Source code file extension: cpp
:File names: all-lower-case-with-hyphens.cpp

Best practices in C++
=====================

There are some great guidelines on how to code correct and efficient programs in
C++. They are long documents but worth learning for any serious C++ programmer:

+ The `C++ Core Guideline`_.
+ The `Google C++ Style Guide`_.

Errors
======

Three types of errors for C++ as a typical compiled programming language:

Syntax error
  Also known as compilation error. It will be identified by the compiler and
  will stop the compilation process. Any program with syntax errors cannot be
  compiled.
Runtime error
  Errors that abort a compiled program during its runtime. Any program with
  runtime errors can be compiled but will abort when it is executed.
Logic error
  Errors that cause a program to provide unexpected outcome. Any program with
  logic errors can compile and run but fail to give the correct outcome.
