<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Module 2, we will delve into the crucial aspect of data storage for big
data. Understanding how to effectively store and manage large volumes of data
is essential for organizations dealing with big data challenges. In this
module, we will explore the key considerations and techniques involved in
storing big data.</p>
<section id="what-we-care-most">
<h3>What we care most<a class="headerlink" href="#what-we-care-most" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to data storage for big data, there are several factors that we
prioritize to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness. Let’s examine
the key aspects that we care most about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scalability - Volume</p>
<p>Scalability is crucial when dealing with big data as the volume of data can
be immense. Traditional storage systems may not be able to handle the growing
volume effectively. Therefore, we focus on employing scalable storage
solutions that can accommodate the increasing volume of data without
compromising performance.</p>
<p>For example, organizations often utilize distributed file systems like Apache
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or object storage systems like Amazon
S3 that can scale horizontally by adding more storage nodes as the data
volume expands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cost - Volume</p>
<p>Big data storage can become expensive if not managed efficiently. As the
volume of data grows, the cost of storage infrastructure, maintenance, and
operations can increase significantly. Therefore, we emphasize cost-effective
storage solutions that balance performance and cost considerations.</p>
<p>For instance, cloud storage services such as Amazon Glacier or Google Cloud Storage Nearline offer lower-cost options for storing infrequently accessed or archival data, reducing overall storage expenses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Performance - Velocity, Volume</p>
<p>Big data is often characterized by high velocity, where data is generated and
consumed at a rapid pace. Additionally, the sheer volume of data can pose
performance challenges if not handled properly. Hence, we focus on storage
systems that can deliver high-performance capabilities to handle the velocity
and volume of data effectively.</p>
<p>One approach to achieve high performance is through distributed storage
architectures like Apache Cassandra, which employs a peer-to-peer model for
storing and retrieving data across multiple nodes, enabling parallel
processing and faster data access.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data organization and structure - Variety</p>
<p>Big data encompasses various types of data, including structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data. Efficient organization and structure
are crucial to enable effective data analysis and processing. Therefore, we
prioritize storage solutions that support different data formats and enable
efficient data organization.</p>
<p>For example, NoSQL databases like MongoDB provide flexible schema designs,
allowing for the storage and retrieval of diverse data structures, making
them suitable for handling the variety of big data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Robustness, error tolerance - Veracity, Variety</p>
<p>Big data sources may be prone to errors, inconsistencies, and outliers, which
can impact the quality and reliability of the data. Hence, we emphasize
robust storage mechanisms that ensure data integrity and error tolerance,
especially when dealing with diverse and potentially unreliable data sources.</p>
<p>Techniques such as data replication, distributed storage redundancy, and
error detection mechanisms like checksums or data checksumming algorithms
help ensure the veracity and reliability of big data.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<section id="traditional-data-storage">
<h3>Traditional data storage<a class="headerlink" href="#traditional-data-storage" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When discussing data storage for big data, it is important to understand the
traditional approaches that have been commonly used. Let’s examine two widely
used traditional data storage methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>File system (local) - unstructured, and semi-structured data</p>
<p>File systems have long been used to store unstructured and semi-structured
data. They provide a hierarchical structure for organizing files and folders.
Traditional file systems, such as those found in operating systems like
Windows, Mac OS or Linux, are suitable for storing individual files or small
datasets.</p>
<p>However, when dealing with big data, the limitations of local file systems
become obvious. They may struggle to handle large volumes of data
efficiently, lack scalability, and suffer from performance bottlenecks when
accessed concurrently by multiple users or processes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) - structured data</p>
<p>Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) have been the go-to solution
for structured data storage for many years. RDBMS offer a structured and
tabular format for data storage, where data is organized into tables with
predefined schemas and relationships defined by primary and foreign keys.</p>
<p>RDBMS provide powerful querying capabilities using SQL (Structured Query
Language) and support transactional integrity. They are well-suited for
applications that require data consistency and complex relational queries.</p>
<p>However, when dealing with big data, RDBMS may face challenges in terms of
scalability and performance. The rigid schema and ACID (Atomicity,
Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties of RDBMS may hinder the
efficient processing of large volumes of data and the flexibility required
for handling diverse data types.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<section id="types-of-data-storage-for-big-data">
<h3>Types of Data storage for big data<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-data-storage-for-big-data" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the context of big data, various types of data storage technologies have
emerged to address the unique requirements and challenges posed by large
volumes of data. Let’s explore three prominent types of data storage solutions
for big data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Distributed file system</p>
<p>A distributed file system is designed to handle massive amounts of data by
distributing it across multiple storage nodes. Some popular examples of
distributed file systems include Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and
Google File System (GFS). Here are the key characteristics of distributed
file systems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Data organized as files: In a distributed file system, data is organized
and accessed as files, similar to traditional file systems. This allows for
the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data.</p></li>
<li><p>High performance: Distributed file systems leverage parallel processing and
data replication to achieve high-performance data storage and retrieval.
They can efficiently handle large-scale data processing tasks by
distributing the workload across multiple nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Good scalability: Distributed file systems are designed to scale
horizontally by adding more storage nodes as data volume increases. This
scalability enables organizations to accommodate the growing demands of big
data storage.</p></li>
<li><p>File system access protocol: Distributed file systems typically provide
their own access protocols for interacting with the stored data. For
example, HDFS uses the Hadoop Distributed File System Protocol (HDFS
protocol) for file operations.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Object store</p>
<p>An object store is a storage architecture that organizes data as objects
rather than files or blocks. It offers highly scalable and cost-effective
storage solutions for big data. Notable examples of object stores include
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) and Google Cloud Storage. Let’s explore
the characteristics of object stores:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Data organized as objects: In an object store, data is organized as
discrete objects, each with its own unique identifier and associated
metadata. This approach enables efficient storage and retrieval of
unstructured and semi-structured data.</p></li>
<li><p>Perfect scalability: Object stores are designed for near-limitless
scalability, allowing organizations to store and manage vast amounts of
data without worrying about storage capacity constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>Low cost: Object stores often offer cost-effective storage options,
especially for infrequently accessed or archival data. By leveraging
storage tiers and lifecycle policies, organizations can optimize costs by
moving data to lower-cost storage tiers as it becomes less frequently
accessed.</p></li>
<li><p>RESTful API, HTTP protocol: Object stores typically provide a RESTful API
(Application Programming Interface) that allows developers to interact with
the stored objects using HTTP-based operations. This makes it easy to
integrate and access data from various applications and systems.d</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>NoSQL database</p>
<p>NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are designed to handle the requirements of
storing and processing large volumes of structured and semi-structured data.
NoSQL databases offer excellent scalability and flexibility for big data
storage. Let’s examine the characteristics of NoSQL databases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Data organized as records, documents, and nodes: NoSQL databases employ
various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph, to
organize and store data. Each data model provides specific benefits for
different types of data.</p></li>
<li><p>Perfect scalability: NoSQL databases are built for horizontal scalability,
allowing them to handle massive data volumes and high-velocity data
ingestion. They can distribute data across multiple nodes and scale
seamlessly as data grows.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimized for structures: NoSQL databases optimize data storage and
retrieval for specific data structures. For example, document-oriented
NoSQL databases like MongoDB excel at storing and querying JSON-like
documents, making them ideal for handling semi-structured data.</p></li>
<li><p>Query protocol: Each NoSQL database offers its own query protocol or API
for interacting with the data. For instance, MongoDB utilizes a flexible
and powerful query language called MongoDB Query Language (MQL) for
querying and manipulating data.</p></li>
</ul>
