Module 1: Introduction To Parallel Programming
**********************************************

Motivation
==========
+ Moore's law

  * chip density hit the limit
  * single core performance hit the limit
  * multicore system emerge

+ Hardware price drops

  * CPU
  * Memory
  * Storage
  * Network devices

+ In need of parallel program

  * make use of parallel hardware

+ Terminology

  * Concurrent

    - can be fake parallelism based on fast switching
    - e.g. Unix Time-sharing system

  * Parallel

    - Tightly coupled
    - e.g. High performance computing cluster
    - e.g. Supercomputer

  * Distributed

    - Loosely coupled
    - grid computation
    - crypto network
