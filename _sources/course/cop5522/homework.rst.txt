Homework Instruction
********************

The purpose of the homework is to help students to develop not only the
programming skill, but also the skill to perform academic research. Thus, the
homework usually consists multiple parts including implementation and report
writing. A typical report should include parts like problem description,
solution design and implementation, experiment design, evaluation, result
discussion and conclusion.

Implementation
==============
According to the requirement of the homework, prepare the submission with
source code files, supporting files, with a working makefile to compile your
project. You can also provide documentations to describe how the code should be
used if the process is not straight forward.

Report
======
The recommended structure of the report include multiple sections:

#. Introduction
#. Methods (design, experiment setup, evaluation plan, etc.)
#. Implementation details
#. Results
#. Discussion and reflection
#. Conclusion

This is a recommendation only and you can choose your organization of
paragraphs. The purpose is to have a clear report of your work emphasizing your
contributions and your conclusion.
