Topics
======
Environment
-----------
+ Know the toolchain: g++, make, git
+ Windows environment: WSL only! No MinGW!
+ Building process of modular programs

  * Three steps: preprocessing, compilation, linking
  * Multi-step compilation:

    1. Preprocessing + compilation: `g++ -c`
    2. Linking: `g++` without `-c`

  * Makefile (basics only)

    - Write a simple rule with three parts: target, dependencies,
      recipe/commands
    - ``clean`` target
    - Triggering rules ``make <target>``, ``make``, ``make <target list>``

      + first target is default

+ Code organization

  * Header: public declarations of functions, classes, global variables
  * Source/cpp: everything else

    - Private declarations
    - Definitions

+ Conventions in this class

  * Naming, casing: camelCase for functions and variables, PascalCase
    for classes and structs, all lowercase for file names
  * File extensions: hpp, cpp
  * Documentation and comments

+ git

  * clone, add, commit, push, status

Math
----
+ Exponent: know the definition
+ Logarithm: know the definition, :math:`log(n)` is less complex than :math:`n`
+ Modulus: know the definition, applications in random number generation and
  hash table
+ Proof methods: know definitions

Algorithm Analysis
------------------
+ Definition
+ Two types: empirical and theoretical
+ Asymptotic definitions

  * Big-O notation: definition, upper bound
  * Big-Omega notation: definition, lower bound
  * Big-Theta notation: definition, exact bound
  * Little-O notation: definition, upper bound, not asymptotically tight

+ Best/worst/average cases

  * relationship to upper/lower bounds
  * relationship to asymptotic notation

+ Estimate big-O

  * know big-O for common algorithms

Amortized Analysis
------------------
+ Definition
+ Motivation

Tree
----
+ Definitions: computer science vs graph theory; recursive
+ Concepts

  * root, leaf, internal nodes
  * parent, child, sibling, ancestor, descendant
  * path, length of path, depth of nodes, level of nodes, height of tree
  * degree of node, degree of tree
  * Able to find and different on a tree diagram

+ Characteristics

  * ordered vs unordered

+ Behaviors

  * traversal: definitions of preorder, inorder (discussed with binary tree),
    postorder, level-order
  * search: definitions of depth-first search, breadth-first search
  * insertion: discussed in BST
  * deletion: discussed in BST

+ Implementation

  * variable number of children
  * first child, next sibling

Binary Tree
-----------
+ Definition: degree 2 ordered tree
+ Three special types

  * full binary tree
  * complete binary tree
  * perfect binary tree

+ Applications

Binary Search Tree
------------------
+ Definition of search tree
+ Behaviors: know the details on how they work on paper

  * search
  * insertion: always at leaf
  * deletion: three cases, how successor/predecessor is used

+ Analysis

  * determined by tree height
  * ideal tree height: :math:`\Theta(\log n)`
  * worst case tree height: :math:`\Theta(n)`
  * degradation of efficiency: unbalance tree or even a list

Self-balancing
--------------
+ Motivation: avoid degradation of efficiency
+ Definition: height-balanced automatically

AVL Tree
--------
+ Name: Adelson-Velskii and Landis
+ Balance factor: :math:`BF = h_l - h_r`, know how to calculate on diagram
+ Balance condition: :math:`BF \in \{-1, 0, 1\}`
+ Self-balancing

  * triggered: insertion/deletion causes balance factor to be +2/-2
  * recursively check balance factor and rotate from bottom up

+ Imbalance and rotation types

  * LL imbalance - right rotation
  * RR imbalance - left rotation
  * LR imbalance - left-right double rotation
  * RL imbalance - right-left double rotation

+ Tricky points

  * -1 for nullptr as a subtree height
  * Positive BF means left subtree is taller; negative BF means right subtree
    is taller

B-Tree
------
+ Name: Bayer and McCreight, Balanced tree
+ N-ary search tree
+ Application:

  * index in file system and database

+ Always balanced
+ Behaviors

  * search
  * insertion

    - always at leaf
    - adjustment when full

      - split and promote middle key
      - check full recursively from bottom up to root

  * deletion

    - internal or leaf node
    - how successor/predecessor is used when deleting from internal node
    - adjustment when underflow

      + borrow from sibling
      + merge with sibling

B+ Tree
-------
+ Difference from B-tree

  * internal nodes do not store data, it stores the duplicate keys of its
    predecessor or successor position in leaves
  * leaf nodes are linked together to allow sequential access
  * all data are stored in leaves

+ Pro and con vs B-tree

  * sequential and range access
  * less key redistribution between internal nodes and leaves

+ Application:

  * index in file system and database

Problem Classification By The Goal
----------------------------------
+ Enumeration: can cover optimization, counting, search, decision
+ Search
+ Optimization: allows approximate algorithms
+ Decision
+ Counting
+ Evaluation

Algorithmic Classification
--------------------------
+ By Paradigm

  * **brute force**
  * **divide and conquer**
  * **greedy**
  * **dynamic programming**
  * **backtracking**
  * branch and bound (not covered)

+ By data structure

  * **array**
  * **linked list**
  * **tree**
  * **graph**

+ By characteristics

  * Exact vs approximate
  * Deterministic vs randomized (non deterministic)

Brute-Force
-----------
+ Definition
+ No optimization, pruning, or heuristic
+ Exact algorithms
+ Can solve optimization, enumeration, search
+ Exponent or factorial time complexity

Backtracking
------------
+ Definition
+ Two approaches

  * recursive: base case, recursive case, backtracking operation
  * iterative: use of stack

+ Feasibility check to reject partial solutions
+ Backtracking operation when partial solution is rejected
+ Steps in pseudocode

Genetic Algorithm
-----------------
+ Inspiration from natural evolution
+ Approximation algorithm

  * not guaranteed to find the optimal solution
  * can find a good solution in a reasonable amount of time

+ Characteristics: brief understanding
+ Concepts

  * population
  * individual and encoding - binary, integer, real-valued, permutation
  * selection - roulette wheel, tournament selection
  * fitness
  * crossover - one-point crossover, two-point crossover
  * mutation - bit flip, swap mutation
  * replacement - elitism, generational replacement, steady-state replacement

+ Parameters

  * population size
  * crossover rate
  * mutation rate
  * number of generations (if not using other termination condition)

+ Steps in pseudocode
