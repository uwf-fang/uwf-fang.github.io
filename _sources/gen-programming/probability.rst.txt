Probability in Computer Science
*******************************
Overview
========
+ **Definition:** Probability quantifies the likelihood of an event or outcome
  occurring. It is a measure between 0 (implying the event cannot happen) and 1
  (implying the event is certain to happen).

  It is often represented as a fraction, decimal, or percentage. For instance,
  the probability of flipping a fair coin to get heads is 0.5 or 50%.

+ **Applications:**

  - Algorithm Efficiency

    Many algorithms, especially randomized algorithms, rely on probabilistic
    principles to optimize efficiency and provide approximate solutions to
    complex problems.

  - Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

    Probabilistic models help in predicting future events based on historical
    data, which is crucial in machine learning and data mining.

  - System Reliability

    Probability helps in evaluating the reliability and performance of systems,
    networks, and software, enabling better design and troubleshooting.

+ **Relationship to combinatorics:**

  By understanding the total number of possible outcomes (from combinatorics)
  and the number of desired outcomes, we can assess the likelihood of specific
  events.

Types of Probability
====================
+ Classical Probability

  Defined for situations where outcomes are equally likely. This method is
  deterministic in nature. This method is related to combinatorics.

  **Examples**:

    - Flipping a fair coin: The probability of getting a head or tail is
      equally 0.5.
    - Rolling a fair six-sided die: The probability of any given side is 1/6.

+ Empirical (or Experimental) Probability (FYI)

  Based on observations, experiments, or historical data rather than
  theoretical calculation.

+ Subjective Probability (FYI)

  Derived from personal judgment, intuition, or belief, rather than any
  objective or empirical evidence. It's less formal and more based on
  individual perspectives.

Basic Rules and Principles of Probability
=========================================

Probability of an Event
-----------------------
Every event has a probability between 0 and 1, inclusive.

- :math:`0 \leq P(A) \leq 1` for any event :math:`A`.
- **Interpretation**:

  - A probability of 0 means the event is impossible.
  - A probability of 1 means the event is certain.

Sample Space and Events
-----------------------
The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is the sample space, and any
subset of this sample space is an event.

- Tossing a coin: Sample space = {Heads, Tails}.

The Additive Rule
-----------------
For two mutually exclusive (or disjoint) events, the probability that either
occurs is the sum of their probabilities.

- :math:`P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)` for mutually exclusive events :math:`A` and
  :math:`B`.

Complementary Events
--------------------
The event that A doesn't happen is called the complement of A.

- :math:`P(A') = 1 - P(A)`, where :math:`A'` is the complement of :math:`A`.

Multiplicative Rule
-------------------
For two independent events, the probability that both occur is the product of
their probabilities.

- :math:`P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)` for independent events :math:`A` and
  :math:`B`.

Conditional Probability (FYI)
-----------------------------
The probability of an event :math:`A` given that another event :math:`B` has
occurred.

- :math:`P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}`, provided :math:`P(B) \neq 0`.

- **Interpretation**: Provides a way to update our probability based on new
  evidence.


Bayes' Theorem (FYI)
====================
Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics
that helps us update our beliefs or assess the likelihood of an event happening
based on new evidence or information. It's like a mathematical tool for making
informed decisions in uncertain situations.

At its core, Bayes' theorem is about conditional probability, which means
calculating the probability of something occurring given that something else
has already occurred. It's named after the 18th-century statistician and
philosopher Thomas Bayes, who developed the idea.

The Formula
-----------
Bayes' Theorem provides a way to find a probability when certain other
probabilities are known.

- **Formula**:

  .. math::

     P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}

  Where:

  - :math:`P(A|B)` is the posterior probability: the probability of hypothesis
       :math:`A` given data :math:`B`.
  - :math:`P(B|A)` is the likelihood: the probability of data :math:`B` given
       hypothesis :math:`A`.
  - :math:`P(A)` is the prior probability: the probability of hypothesis
       :math:`A` before seeing the data.
  - :math:`P(B)` is the marginal likelihood: the total probability of observing
       data :math:`B`.

Bayes' Theorem Example
----------------------
Imagine you're a detective trying to solve a mystery, and you have a suspect in
mind. You initially have a belief, or a prior belief, about how likely it is
that this suspect committed the crime. This belief is based on your previous
knowledge, but it's not certain.

Now, as you investigate further, you gather new evidence, like fingerprints or
eyewitness testimonies. Bayes' theorem helps you combine your initial belief
(the prior) with this new evidence to update your belief (the posterior) about
the suspect's guilt.

In other words:

#. You start with an initial belief (prior probability).
#. You gather new evidence.
#. You use Bayes' theorem to calculate how likely your initial belief is, given
   the new evidence (posterior probability).

Significance in Computer Science
--------------------------------
Bayes' Theorem is foundational in various computer science domains, especially
those that require inference from data.

- **Machine Learning**
- **Data Analysis**
- **Decision Making**
- **Filtering and Prediction**

Applying Combinatorics in Classic Probability
=============================================
In classic probability, all events have a same likelihood. Thus, we can use
combinatorics to determine the total number of possible outcomes and the number
of desired outcomes, which allows us to calculate the probability of an event.

.. note::

  :math:`P` denotes probability, not permutation here!

Card Games (Poker Hands)
------------------------
**Question**: What is the probability of getting a royal flush in poker when
dealt 5 cards from a standard 52-card deck?

- **Solution**:

  - Combinatorial Approach: There are :math:`C^{52}_{5}` ways to choose 5
    cards from 52, and only 4 ways to get a royal flush (one for each suit).
  - Probability: :math:`P(\text{Royal Flush}) = \frac{4}{C^{52}_{5}}`

Dice Games (Yahtzee)
--------------------
**Question**: What is the probability of rolling a Yahtzee (five dice showing
the same number) in one roll?

- **Solution**:

  - Combinatorial Approach: There are :math:`6^5` possible outcomes when
    rolling 5 dice, and 6 possible Yahtzees (one for each number 1-6).
  - Probability: :math:`P(\text{Yahtzee}) = \frac{6}{6^5}`

Lottery Drawings
----------------
**Question**: What is the probability of winning a lottery where you must
correctly pick 6 numbers out of 49?

- **Solution**:

  - Combinatorial Approach: There are :math:`C^{49}_{6}` ways to choose 6
    numbers from 49.
  - Probability: :math:`P(\text{Winning}) = \frac{1}{C^{49}_{6}}`

Arranging Books on a Shelf
--------------------------
**Question**: If you have 10 different books and want to place 2 specific books
next to each other, what's the probability this happens at random?

- **Solution**:

  - Combinatorial Approach: Consider the 2 specific books as one item. There
    are 9! ways to arrange these 9 items, and 2! ways to arrange the 2 books
    among themselves. There are 10! ways to arrange all books without any
    restrictions.
  - Probability: :math:`P(\text{2 Books Together}) = \frac{9! \times 2!}{10!}`

Drawing Colored Balls from a Bag
--------------------------------
**Question**: In a bag with 5 red, 4 blue, and 6 green balls, what's the
probability of drawing 2 red balls consecutively without replacement?

- **Solution**:

  - Combinatorial Approach: There are :math:`C^{5}_{2}` ways to choose 2 red
    balls and :math:`C^{15}_{2}` ways to choose any 2 balls from 15.
  - Probability: :math:`P(\text{2 Red Balls}) = \frac{C^{5}_{2}}{C^{15}_{2}}`
