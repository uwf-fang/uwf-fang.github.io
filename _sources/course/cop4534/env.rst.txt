Development Environment
***********************
This chapter revisits the development environment and tools that are required
to complete the course. It have been covered in the prerequisite courses
already, but I will quickly go over them again here.

The development environment a setup of tools for developing, testing an
application or a library. In this course, we require student to understand how
to set up a development environment on your computer and how to work with
remote server including the department SSH server and the GitHub classroom.

The recommended development environment and tools are employed in demonstration
and will be supported by the instructor and the TA. However, students are free
to use other tools as long as they can complete the course project. You are on
your own if you choose to use other tools, though. The instructor and the TA
may not be familiar with your tools and may not be able to help you.
