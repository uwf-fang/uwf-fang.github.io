Report Writing Guidelines
=========================

This document provides guidelines for writing a scientific report. It outlines
a general format reminiscent of traditional scientific paper structures.

Suggested Sections
==================

Scientific Report
-----------------
A typical scientific report should ideally comprise the following sections:

- **Abstract** (optional)

  * A concise summary of the report.
  * Should be able to stand alone.
  * Briefly covers the problem, methodology, results, and conclusion.

- **Introduction**

  * Background information.
  * Motivation for the study.
  * Relevant related works.
  * Summary of the problem and how it will be addressed.

- **Methods**

  * Design approach
  * Experimental setup
  * Evaluation strategy

- **Implementation Details** (if applicable)

- **Results**

  * Present data in an organized manner using graphs, tables, etc.

- **Discussion and Reflection** (optional)

  * Delve into the results, especially if they deviate from expectations or if
    there's potential for enhancement.

- **Conclusion**

  * Recap the problem, methodology, and results.
  * Optionally, revisit the discussion points.
  * Conclude with final thoughts or implications.

Depending on the type of report you are writing, you may not need to include
all of these sections. For example, a progress report may not require a
discussion section. A proposal may focus on the introduction and methods with
optional implementation and results sections.

Project Proposal
----------------
A proposal is generally written to persuade the reader of the need for a
project or research and to outline steps or methods to achieve the objectives.

- **Objective**

  * Clearly state the goals of the proposal.

- **Introduction**

  * Focus on the motivation and justification.

- **Methods**

  * Most important section for a proposal.
  * Describe the approach to be taken.
  * Why is this approach suitable?
  * Novelty of the approach.

- **Budget/Resource allocation**

  * List the resources required to complete the project.
  * Estimated cost breakdown if relevant.
  * List organizational resources such as personnel, equipment, and
    facilities.

- **Timeline**

  * Provide a timeline for the project.
  * Include milestones and deliverables.

Review
------
A review examines existing literature or products in a field to provide an
overview, comparison, or evaluation.

- **Introduction**

  * Purpose of the review
  * Scope of the review
  * Criteria for selection of literature or products

- **Body**

  * Choose a suitable structure for the review.

    - Chronological
    - Thematic
    - Methodological

  * Summarize the literature or products.
  * Compare and contrast the literature or products.

- **Conclusion**

  * Summarize the review.
  * Highlight the key points.
  * Discuss the implications.
  * Identify gaps.
  * Suggest future work.

Common Pitfalls & Recommendations
=================================

1. Avoid an overly lengthy introduction and methods section. While these
   sections are vital, the essence of your report lies in the results.
   Prioritize accordingly.
2. Do not merely enumerate the results. Analyze, interpret, and discuss their
   implications. Concluding thoughts should be derived from these discussions.
3. Ensure a logical flow in presenting your data. Avoid a mere chronological
   arrangement, which can read like a diary. Aim for a structured and
   analytical presentation.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can produce a clear, concise, and
impactful report.
