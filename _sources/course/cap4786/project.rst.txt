Learning outcome
================
+ Learn how to employ Spark SQL to process data.

Objective
=========
+ Process COVID-19 data using Spark SQL.

COVID-19 Data Processing
========================
This is a pretty open project without provided notebook template. Please make
your own notebook to complete the tasks.

Data Source
-----------
+ The data is from the Kaggle:
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset
+ We will be using an old version hosted in our GitHub dataset repository:
  https://github.com/uwf-fang-teaching/cap4786-datasets/tree/main/covid
+ You can always click the file and click "Raw" to get the URL to access the
  file.
+ Downloading from URL in your DCE notebook is recommended.

Tasks
-----
1. Load the data into a Spark DataFrames. Only load the csv files needed for
   the future tasks. Show the schema of each DataFrame.
2. Show the top ten countries with the most recoveries.
3. Show the longitude and latitude of the top 10 countries with the most
   recoveries. Join #2 result and the longitude and latitude data.
4. Show the symptoms by country.
5. Show the average age of death by country ordered by age.
6. Rank the countries by the number of deaths.

Hints
-----
+ General data exist in the "covid_19_data.csv" file.
+ The longitude and latitude data exist in the
  "time_series_covid_19_confirmed.csv" file.
+ The symptoms data exist in the "COVID19_open_line_list.csv" file.
+ The age data exist in the "COVID19_line_list_data.csv" file.

Requirement
===========
+ Provide a report in DCE notebook format.
+ **Make your report organized and easy to read!**
+ The report should contain both code and text.
+ Write markdown cells for your descriptive contents.
+ Write code cells for your code and keep the output.
+ Split cells by the logical steps of your analysis.

Bonus
-----
+ 20% bonus points
+ Do you notice any data quality issues? If so, how would you address them?

  * Good enough to find one dataframe with data quality issues
  * Describe the issue
  * Suggest how to fix it
