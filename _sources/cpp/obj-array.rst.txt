Object Array

Multiple arrays
---------------

+ store data in various arrays, same index means same record

  E.g. grades[i] and names[i] refers to the grade and name of a same student

    .. code-block:: c++

      const int NUM_STUDENT = 100; // max number of students
      double grades[NUM_STUDENT];
      string names[NUM_STUDENT];
      cout << "The 5th student in the list " << names[6] << " has a grade of " << grades[6];

+ old-school method inherited from C language
+ Better alternative: a single array of struct/class (or std::pair)

  E.g. student[i].grade and student[i].name refers to the grade and
  name of a same student

    .. code-block:: c++

      struct Student {
        double grade;
        string name;
      };

      Student students[NUM_STUDENT];
      cout << "The 5th student in the list " << students[6].name << " has a grade
          of " << students[6].grade;
