******************
Heap and Heap Sort
******************

Heap
====
+ Definition

  A complete binary tree in which parent node is always less/greater (min/max
  heap) or equal (if allow overlapped values) than its children

+ Logically a complete tree
+ physically an array

  * find parent/children by arithmetic calculation of indices

+ type

  * max heap
  * min heap

+ behaviors

  * insert

    - insert at the end
    - swap with its parent if it violate the rule (percolate up)
    - keep checking all ancestors till the root is reached

  * remove

    - remove the root by overwriting it using the last element
    - swap the parent node with its least/greatest child starting from the root
      until the leaf node is reached (percolate down)

  * percolate up/down

    - move one element up/down in an existing heap

Heap sort
=========
#. heapify the array (turn randomly ordered array into a heap)

   * percolate repeatedly

     - index ranged from size / 2 to 0

#. removing the root node repeatedly from a heap

   * move root to the sorted region by swapping it with the last leaf
   * percolate the root down
   * next round

Priority queue
--------------
* Not really a queue or stack because the dequeue order is not related to the
  enqueue order
* any in min/max out
* behaviors same as a queue or a stack

  - enqueue
  - dequeue
  - peek
  - isEmpty
  - length
