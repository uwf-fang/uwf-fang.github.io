  * Eclipse will create a project folder containing many supporting files
    **Never include these files in your submission**

+ You can choose other IDEs or editors

  * Visual Studio Code

    - Tutorial: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java

  * IntelliJ IDEA
  * NetBeans

+ Java version

  * Later than Java 8
  * OpenJDK or Oracle both fine

Run your code
=============
+ Use the run/debug feature in your IDE or editor (software-specific)
+ Use command-line (more universal and portable way)

  * ``java`` command to run
  * ``javac`` command to compile .java file to .class file

Workflows
=========
+ You may use multiple approaches for different use cases
+ Use an IDE and define project every time
+ Use an editor and compile/run from command-line

  * Visual Studio Code

+ Use jGrasp

  * Works well with our code example repository
  * Works well when working with many projects all at once

    - requires all files in a single folder for each project
    - requires all classes in the default package (no package statements)
