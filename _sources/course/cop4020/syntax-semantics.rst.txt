Syntax And Semantics In Programming Languages
*********************************************

Definition
==========
- Syntax: The syntax of a programming language is the set of rules that
  defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly
  structured programs in that language.
- Semantics: The semantics of a programming language is the set of rules that
  defines the meaning of the programs in that language.

Formal Language Theory
======================
Formal language theory is a branch of mathematics and computer science that
deals with the theoretical properties of formal languages.

Components of a language (including programming languages)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Alphabet: A finite set of symbols.
- String: A sequence of symbols from the alphabet.
- Language: A set of strings.
- Grammar: A set of rules that generate strings in a language.

Related Concepts
----------------
- Automata theory: Study of abstract machines and their computational
  capabilities. Automata are used to recognize patterns in strings for a specific language.
- Chomsky hierarchy: A classification of formal languages based on their
  generative power.

Chomsky Hierarchy
-----------------
.. csv-table::
   :header: "Type", "Grammar", "Automaton", "Language Example"

   "Type 0", "Unrestricted", "Turing Machine (TM)", "Any language"
   "Type 1", "Context-sensitive", "Linear-bounded automaton (LBA)", "Most languages"
   "Type 2", "Context-free", "Pushdown automaton (PDA)", "Expression grammar"
   "Type 3", "Regular", "Finite automaton (FA)", "Regular expressions, Lexemes"

Notation Systems
----------------
+ Chomsky notation: describes any formal grammar
+ Backus-Naur Form (BNF): describes context-free grammars
+ Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF): equivalent to BNF but more readable

Formal Language Theory In Programming Languages
===============================================
Scope
-----
- Formal language theory fully handles the syntax of programming languages.
- Semantics requires more advanced mathematical tools.

Syntax
------
- Lexeme/Token level: the smallest unit of syntax.

  - Usually as regular languages.
  - **Alphabet**: ASCII character
  - **String**: Lexeme
  - **Grammar**: Rule to construct lexemes
  - Tokens: Category of lexemes

- Syntax level: the structure of the program.

  - Usually as context-free languages.
  - **Alphabet**: Tokens
  - **String**: Program
  - **Grammar**: Rule to construct programs

Compiler/Interpreter Implementation
===================================
- Lexical analysis

  * Lexer/tokenizer/scanner
  * Goal:

    + Breaks the program into lexemes
    + Assigns tokens to lexemes

- Syntax analysis

  * Parser
  * Goal:

    + Checks the structure of the program (syntax) for correctness
    + Generates a parse tree

  * Limitations:

    + Most parsers can only handle a subset of context-free languages
    + Limits the expressiveness of the language

  * Types:

    + Top-down vs bottom-up
    + LL vs LR

- Semantic analysis

  * Extensions to the parser to handle context-sensitive portion of the
    language.
  * Examples:

    - Static semantics uses type systems and attribute grammars
    - Dynamic semantics uses operational, denotational, or axiomatic approaches
    - Goes beyond what formal language theory can describe
