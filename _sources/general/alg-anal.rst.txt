Definition
==========
Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating and studying the performance
characteristics of algorithms to understand how well they solve specific
computational problems or tasks.

Motivation
==========
The primary motivation for algorithm analysis is to make informed decisions
when choosing an algorithm for a particular problem or task. By analyzing
algorithms, computer scientists and engineers can determine which algorithm is
the most suitable for a given situation based on factors like time complexity,
space complexity, and practical considerations.

Provide better understanding on:

+ Performance
+ Efficiency
+ Resource usage
+ Scalability
+ Trade-offs
+ Guarantee
+ Limitations

Goals
=====
1. **Quantify Efficiency:** Determine how efficiently an algorithm performs its
   task in terms of time and space requirements. This quantification allows for
   the comparison of different algorithms for the same problem.

2. **Predict Behavior:** Predict how an algorithm's performance scales as the
   size of the input data increases. This prediction helps in estimating the
   algorithm's feasibility for large datasets.

3. **Identify Optimal Solutions:** Determine whether an algorithm is optimal or
   whether there are opportunities for optimization to achieve better
   efficiency.

4. **Make Informed Choices:** Assist in selecting the most appropriate
   algorithm for a specific problem or application based on its performance
   characteristics.

Components
==========
Empirical and theoretical analysis are two essential components of algorithm
analysis, each providing distinct ways of evaluating and understanding the
performance of algorithms:

Empirical Analysis
------------------
Empirical analysis of algorithms involves running algorithms on actual input
data and measuring their performance empirically. This approach relies on
experimentation and real-world data rather than mathematical abstraction.

Theoretical Analysis
--------------------
Theoretical analysis of algorithms involves a mathematical and abstract
evaluation of an algorithm's performance without actually running the algorithm
on real inputs.

In the realm of theoretical analysis of algorithms, a crucial aspect that
deserves special attention is the concept of complexity. Complexity analysis
allows us to characterize and compare the efficiency of algorithms in a
systematic and abstract manner. Complexity measures, such as time complexity
and space complexity, provide a structured framework for understanding how an
algorithm's performance scales with input size.

Factors Affecting Performance
=============================
+ Input Data: The nature of the input data can significantly impact algorithm
  performance. Different algorithms may perform better or worse depending on
  the characteristics of the data.
+ Hardware and Environment: The performance of algorithms can vary based on the
  specific hardware and environment in which they are executed. Factors like
  CPU speed, memory capacity, and caching mechanisms can influence execution
  times.
