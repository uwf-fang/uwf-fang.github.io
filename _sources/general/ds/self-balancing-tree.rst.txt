Self-balancing Trees
********************

Definition
==========
A self-balancing tree is a type of tree data structure in which the balance or
height of the tree is automatically adjusted during insertions and deletions to
ensure that the tree remains reasonably balanced.

Motivation
==========
The motivation behind self-balancing trees is to overcome the potential
performance issues that can occur in standard trees (including binary and
non-binary trees) due to unbalanced structures. In many tree-based data
structures, the height of the tree significantly impacts the efficiency of
operations like search, insertion, and deletion. Self-balancing trees are
designed to address this challenge and provide consistent, efficient
performance in various scenarios.

Variations
==========
+ Binary search tree family

  * AVL Tree
  * Red-Black Tree

+ B-Tree family

  * B-Tree (B tree, not B minus tree)
  * B+ Tree
  * B* Tree
