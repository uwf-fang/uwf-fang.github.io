Array Basics
============
Only local arrays (arrays declared as local variables) are discussed in this
document.

+ Declaration and initialization::

    int arr[10];
    int arr1[10] = {};
    int arr2[] = {1, 2, 3};

  * size must be specified unless it can be inferred from initialization
  * size must be a compilation-time constant

    - int literals: ``10``
    - pre-defined const variable: ``const int SIZE = 4``

    .. warning::

      Although variable as size is allowed with g++, it is not recommended as
      C++ standard does not allow that.

+ Access the element::

    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
      sum += arr2[i];  // access ith element
    cout << sum << endl;

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      arr[i] = i + 1;  // set the ith element

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      cout << arr[i] << " ";  // print the ith element
    cout << endl;
