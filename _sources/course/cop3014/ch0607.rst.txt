Chapter 6, 7 Algorithm design with Sequential Data Structure
************************************************************

Background
==========

The algorithms covered in this course is mostly C array based. C array as the
fundamental native sequential data structure in C++ is a perfect data structure
to learn algorithms.

Most of the algorithms are based on one dimensional arrays (chapter 6) and these
algorithms can be easily extended to other sequential data structures such as
std::string (chapter 7), C string (chapter 6), std::vector (chapter 11), etc.

Some simple algorithms based on two dimensional arrays are also covered in this
course (chapter 8).

Designing algorithms
====================

+ pseudo-code like a recipe
+ top-down method

  * describe how you solve the problem
  * identify top-level tasks
  * split further into smaller tasks
