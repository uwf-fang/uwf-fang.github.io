Array Basics
============
Only local arrays (arrays declared as local variables) are discussed in this
document.

+ Declaration and initialization::

    int arr[10];
    int arr1[10] = {};
    int arr2[] = {1, 2, 3};

  * size must be specified unless it can be inferred from initialization
  * size must be a compilation-time constant

    - int literals: ``10``
    - pre-defined const variable: ``const int SIZE = 4``

    .. warning::

      Although variable as size is allowed with g++, it is not recommended as
      C++ standard does not allow that.

  ::

    // ---- correct ----
    const int SIZE = 4;
    int arr3[SIZE];

    // ---- wrong ----
    int size = 4;
    int arr4[size];

+ Access the element::

    int sum = 0;
    int arr[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    cout << "The second element is " << arr[1] << endl;
    arr[1] = 12;
    cout << "Second element is set to " << arr[1] << endl;
