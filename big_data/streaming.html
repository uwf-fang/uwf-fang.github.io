<section id="definition-of-data-streaming">
<h2>Definition of data streaming<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-data-streaming" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Streaming for Big Data is a method of processing and analyzing large and
complex data sets in real-time or near real-time. It involves a continuous
flow of data that can be analyzed, processed, and acted upon in real-time as
it is generated. The importance of streaming for Big Data lies in the fact
that traditional data processing methods are not efficient in dealing with
large and continuously generated data sets.</p>
</section>
<section id="real-time-requirements">
<h2>Real-time requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#real-time-requirements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Streaming is useful only when the data needs to be processed in real-time.
Real-time here means that the result of the processing is required within a
few milliseconds or seconds. For example, in the case of stock trading, the
data needs to be processed in real-time to make quick decisions. In the case
of fraud detection, the data needs to be processed in real-time to detect and
prevent fraudulent activities. In the case of IoT devices, the data needs to
be processed in real-time to monitor and control the devices.</p>
<p><strong>Applications that allows for a delay in processing the data, for example, a
few hours or days, do not require streaming.</strong> For example, in the case of
analyzing customer behavior, the data can be processed in batches, for example,
once a day, and the result can be used to make decisions for the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Streaming should be only added to the pipeline when the needs justify the
cost!</strong> For example, in any data application that can perform well with
historical data (a couple of hours or days old, for example), streaming is not
necessary. In applications where real-time data is required, for example, fraud
detection, stock trading, etc., streaming is a must.</p>

<section id="characteristics">
<h2>Characteristics<a class="headerlink" href="#characteristics" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Real-time: Streaming for Big Data allows organizations to process data in
real-time, which means they can act on data insights as they occur. This is
particularly useful for time-sensitive data, such as financial transactions
or sensor data from IoT devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous: Streaming for Big Data involves a continuous flow of data that
can be processed and analyzed without interruption. This means that
organizations can receive and process data in real-time, without having to
wait for batch processing. The continuous processing enables organizations
to quickly and effectively respond to changing conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Heterogeneous: Data streams involves data that is heterogeneous, meaning it
can come from different sources and in various formats. It can include
structured data from traditional databases, as well as unstructured data
from social media feeds, sensor data from IoT devices, and more. This
requires organizations to use advanced analytics techniques to clean,
normalize, and process the data to extract meaningful insights.</p></li>
<li><p>Imperfect: Data streams are often imperfect, meaning it can contain errors,
inconsistencies, or missing values. This requires organizations to use
advanced data quality techniques to identify and fix issues in real-time.
By doing so, they can avoid making decisions based on inaccurate or
incomplete data.</p></li>
<li><p>Volatile: In the context of streaming for big data, “volatile” refers to
the rapid and unpredictable rate of change of data. This characteristic is
particularly relevant for data that is continuously flowing in real-time
from various sources, such as sensors, social media feeds, and other
streaming data.</p>
<p>Organizations must understand the volatility of streaming data to determine
how long it remains relevant and actionable. For instance, sentiment
analysis of social media data can be highly volatile, as opinions can
quickly shift and change. Conversely, certain types of streaming data, such
as weather trends, may have a lower volatility as they are more
predictable.</p>
<p>Understanding the volatility of streaming data is crucial for effective
data management and analysis. Organizations need to implement real-time
analytics tools and techniques that can rapidly process and analyze the
data as it streams in. Failure to properly manage volatile data in
real-time can lead to inaccurate insights, missed opportunities, and
increased business risks.</p>

<section id="advantages-of-streaming">
<h2>Advantages of Streaming<a class="headerlink" href="#advantages-of-streaming" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Real-time: Real-time processing is a critical advantage of data streaming
technology in big data applications. Real-time processing allows
organizations to analyze and process data as it is generated, providing
immediate insights and enabling timely decision-making. With data streaming
technology, data can be analyzed and acted upon within milliseconds or
seconds, which is particularly important in industries such as finance,
healthcare, and transportation where real-time decision-making is critical.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of real-time processing is the ability to detect
and respond to events as they happen. For example, in the financial
industry, real-time processing can be used to detect fraudulent activities
as they occur, preventing financial losses and maintaining customer trust.
In healthcare, real-time processing can be used to monitor patients’ vital
signs, alerting doctors immediately if there are any signs of trouble. In
transportation, real-time processing can be used to track the location of
vehicles, predict traffic patterns, and optimize routes in real-time,
improving efficiency and reducing costs. Real-time processing also enables
organizations to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. For
example, real-time analysis of customer behavior can provide insights into
customer preferences and enable organizations to personalize marketing
messages in real-time, increasing the likelihood of conversion and
improving customer satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scalability is a key advantage of data streaming technology in big data
applications. Data streaming technology can handle large volumes of data
and scale easily to meet increasing data processing demands. As data
volumes grow, data streaming technology can dynamically allocate more
resources to handle the increased workload, ensuring that processing
remains efficient and effective.</p>
<p>One of the key reasons why data streaming technology is so scalable is its
ability to process data in parallel. Data is broken down into small chunks
and processed concurrently, which allows for higher throughput and reduced
processing times. This parallel processing also allows for horizontal
scaling, where additional computing resources can be added to the
processing pipeline to handle increasing data volumes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flexibility: Data streaming technology is highly flexible and can be used
in a variety of applications. It can be used for real-time monitoring,
predictive analytics, fraud detection, and more. Data streaming technology
is not limited to any specific type of data, and it can process data in
many formats, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
This flexibility allows for organizations to use data streaming technology
for a wide range of use cases, such as financial services, healthcare,
retail, manufacturing, and more.</p>
<p>For example, in financial services, data streaming technology can be used
for real-time monitoring of transactions to detect fraudulent activities.
In healthcare, data streaming technology can be used to monitor patients’
vital signs in real-time, providing doctors with instant alerts if any
vital signs fall outside of acceptable ranges. In retail, data streaming
technology can be used for real-time inventory management, ensuring that
products are always available on the shelves.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reduced storage and processing costs:</p>
<p>Reduced storage and processing costs are an important advantage of data
streaming technology in big data applications. Traditional batch processing
methods require large amounts of storage and processing power, which can be
expensive and time-consuming. Data streaming technology, on the other hand,
can significantly reduce storage and processing costs by processing data in
real-time and discarding data that is no longer needed.</p>
<p>With data streaming technology, data is processed as it is generated and
analyzed in real-time. This means that data does not need to be stored in
large quantities before processing, which can significantly reduce storage
costs. In addition, since data is processed in real-time, processing
resources can be allocated more efficiently, reducing processing costs.</p>
