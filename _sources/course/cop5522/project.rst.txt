******************************************************
Research Project: Parallelization of Serial Algorithms
******************************************************

Learning Outcomes
=================
The research project aims to:

- Foster collaborative skills through teamwork on group projects.
- Enhance proficiency in writing scientific articles.
- Familiarize participants with the comprehensive academic research workflow.

Objective
=========
Explore performance optimization by proposing parallel implementations of
established serial algorithms. Participants will design the solution, implement
the optimized design, evaluate its performance, and discuss the results in
depth.

Suggested Workflow
==================
1. **Problem Identification**: Understand and articulate the serial algorithm
   that needs parallel optimization.
2. **Solution Proposition**: Brainstorm and propose potential parallel
   implementations for the identified problem.
3. **Solution Implementation**: Develop the proposed parallel solutions,
   ensuring correct functionality.
4. **Experiment Planning**: Determine the methodology to test and evaluate the
   performance of the parallel solutions.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Analyze the implemented solutions for efficiency
   and improvements over the serial algorithm.
6. **Discussion**: Reflect on the results, potential challenges, and
   implications of the implemented parallel solutions.
7. **Project Conclusion**: Sum up the entire research project, drawing key
   insights and takeaways.

Report Structure
================
Your report should have the following structure:

- **Introduction**: Contextualize the problem and the need for parallel
  optimization.
- **Method**: Describe the parallelization approach, tools, and techniques
  employed.
- **Implementation**: Explain the implementation details of the parallel
  solution.
- **Results and Discussion**: Present the performance improvements and engage
  in a thorough discussion.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize key findings and insights from the project.
- **References**: List all resources, articles, tools, and references used in
  the project.

   - Foreseen challenges and potential mitigation strategies.

2. **Progress Report**:

   Submit a 1-page progress update that includes:

   - A summary of tasks completed so far.
   - Outline of pending tasks.
   - Encountered challenges and any course corrections made in the project
     approach.
   - Reflection on the collaboration within the team.

3. **Final Report**:

   Compile a detailed report on the project. Ensure that the report mirrors the
   format of a professional scientific article, highlighting all crucial
   aspects of the research undertaken.
