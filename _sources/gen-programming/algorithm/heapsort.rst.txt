Heap Sort
*********

Overview
========
Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data
structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum
element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process
for remaining element.

It is first developed by J.W.J. Williams in 1964.

Characteristics
===============
+ Divide and conquer algorithm
+ Comparison based (general purpose)
+ Iterative
+ In-place
+ Efficient
+ Unstable - relative order of equal elements is not preserved

Algorithm Details
=================
#. Heapify the array to build a heap
#. Removing the root node repeatedly from a heap

   * move root to the sorted region by swapping it with the last leaf
   * percolate the root down

Complexity
==========
+ Time :math:`\Theta(n \log n)`
+ Space :math:`\Theta(1)` as an in-place algorithm
