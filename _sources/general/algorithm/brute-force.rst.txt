Brute-force Algorithms
**********************
A brute-force algorithm is a straightforward and exhaustive problem-solving
approach that systematically explores all possible solutions or combinations to
a problem. It does not rely on advanced strategies or optimizations and instead
relies on sheer computational power to find a solution. The term "brute force"
implies that the algorithm forcefully checks every possible option without
taking shortcuts or using heuristics to prune the search space.

Characteristics
===============
+ Exhaustive
+ Naive: no optimization, no heuristics
+ Simple: easy to implement
+ Inefficient: exponential time complexity
+ Deterministic: always produces the same output for a given input

Application Domain
==================
Brute-force algorithms are used when the problem size is small enough to be
practical, especially when no other more efficient solutions are available. It
is also suitable for problems that require all possible solutions to be
examined.

+ Combination and permutation

Implementation
==============
+ Recursive
+ Iterative
