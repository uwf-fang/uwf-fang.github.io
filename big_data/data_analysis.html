<h1>Data Analysis for Big Data: Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#data-analysis-for-big-data-overview" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The term “data analysis” is frequently used to describe either the entire
process of data-driven applications or just the data processing and analysis
steps outlined in the <a class="reference internal" href="big_data_lifecycle.html"><span class="doc">Big Data Life Cycle</span></a>. We will focus on the data
analysis step as the final stage of the lifecycle in which we convert the
prepared datasets to the final products of the application that will provide
value to the user.</p>
<section id="products-of-data-analysis">
<h2>Products of Data Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#products-of-data-analysis" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data analysis involves processing and interpreting large and complex datasets
to extract valuable insights and patterns. The following are the primary
products of data analysis:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Reports and Dashboards: Data analysis results are often presented in the form
of reports and dashboards that provide a concise and intuitive overview of
the insights gained from the data. These visualizations help decision-makers
understand the results of the analysis quickly and easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Models: Models are mathematical representations or approximations of
real-world phenomena created through data analysis. They are used to identify
patterns, relationships, and trends within large data sets, and can be used
for a variety of applications such as prediction, classification, clustering,
and time-series analysis. Models are crucial in gaining insights into complex
systems, testing hypotheses, and optimizing processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimized Algorithm/Procedure: Data analysis can also help to optimize
algorithms and procedures for data processing and analysis. This can result
in faster processing times, improved accuracy, and increased efficiency in
data-driven applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Datasets: Finally, data analysis can guide the creation of new datasets
that can be used to train models, validate results, or further research.
These datasets are often made publicly available to support research and
development in various fields.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To produce these products, the developer will create models to model the data
and extract insights from the data using the models. The insights are described
and visualized to create reports.</p>
<p>When the reports are time sensitive, automatic data pipeline are created to
create real-time reports as a dashboard for real-time monitoring.</p>
<p>The insights can also guide the improvement of certain algorithm or procedure
or confirm the quality of the new datasets to be published for public usage.</p>
<p>There are many types of models ranged from simple statistical model to large
deep learning models. Some models are only useful to generate metrics and
visualizations and some are more powerful machine learning and deep learning
models that can be employed in more advanced tasks. We will focus on machine
learning models in this course.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis in Big Data Context<a class="headerlink" href="#data-analysis-in-big-data-context" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In big data contexts, there are two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start big, finish small</p>
<p>The large volume of data become relatively smaller. Enough to create report,
dashboard, traditional machine learning model and guide the optimization of
algorithm/procedure.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start big, finish big</p>
<p>Start with a big dataset, train a large deep learning model based on that.
Or, create a large datasets.</p>

</ul>
<section id="machine-learning-overview">
<h3>Machine Learning Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#machine-learning-overview" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Machine learning models, including deep learning, are a subset of artificial
intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or
decisions without being explicitly programmed. These models can be trained on
large datasets to identify patterns and relationships in the data and use that
knowledge to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.</p>
<p>Machine learning models, including deep learning, rely on a set of parameters
that are learned during the training process. These parameters determine the
behavior of the model and affect its ability to make accurate predictions or
classifications.</p>
<p>In traditional machine learning models, such as linear regression or logistic
regression, the parameters are learned using analytical solutions or
optimization techniques such as gradient descent. These models have a fixed set
of parameters that are learned during the training process, and they do not
require a large amount of data to train.</p>
<p>Deep learning models, on the other hand, are characterized by having many
layers of interconnected neurons, and a large number of parameters that need to
be learned. These models use stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation to
update the parameters during the training process. The number of parameters in
a deep learning model can be in the millions or even billions, depending on the
size and complexity of the model.</p>

<section id="most-models-are-not-big">
<h3>Most Models Are Not “Big”<a class="headerlink" href="#most-models-are-not-big" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>One important concept to clarify here is that while big data analysis is often
associated with large volumes of data, most data analysis approaches are not
“big” at all, with the exception of large deep learning models. This is because
the amount of information required for many data analysis tasks is often
limited, and can be effectively processed with smaller datasets.</p>
<p>For example, generating a visualization or training a traditional machine
learning model often only requires a subset of the available data. Even when
large datasets are provided, only a limited amount of information may be
extracted from them. In many cases, the performance of a model using a large
volume of data is identical to the performance of the same model using a random
subset of the data.</p>
<p>Therefore, in most data analysis applications, the focus should be on finding
the best subset of the available data to complete the analysis. This can be
achieved by carefully selecting the relevant features or variables, or by using
techniques such as data sampling or dimensionality reduction to reduce the
amount of data without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

<h3>Deep Learning Models for Big Data<a class="headerlink" href="#deep-learning-models-for-big-data" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Deep learning models are a specific type of machine learning model that are
designed to process and analyze large and complex datasets. These models are
based on artificial neural networks that are inspired by the structure and
function of the human brain.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of deep learning models is their ability to learn and
extract complex patterns from data. This is due to their large number of
parameters, which can range from millions to billions, and allows them to model
highly nonlinear and intricate relationships between input and output data.
This makes them particularly useful in applications such as image and speech
recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems, where there
is a vast amount of data that needs to be processed and analyzed.</p>

<p>However, the large number of parameters in deep learning models also means that
they require a significant amount of data to train effectively. In fact, they
are the only exception to the general rule that most data analysis approaches
do not require large datasets. The more data that is available, the more
accurately the model can be trained, and the better its performance will be on
new, unseen data.</p>
<p>As a result, deep learning models are currently the focus of much research in
the field of big data applications. Many industries, including healthcare,
finance, and transportation, are exploring the potential of deep learning
models to analyze and extract insights from their data. However, it is
important to note that the use of deep learning models also comes with its own
set of challenges, including the need for specialized hardware, the risk of
overfitting, and the potential for bias in the data. Therefore, it is important
to carefully consider the suitability of deep learning models for a given task,
and to ensure that they are trained and evaluated appropriately.</p>
