Motivation
==========
+ Moore's law

  * chip density hits the physical limit
  * single core performance hits the physical limit
  * multi-core system emerge

+ Hardware price drops

  * CPU
  * Memory
  * Storage
  * Network devices

+ In need of parallel program

  * Challenges

    - Hard to translate sequential program to parallel program
    - Hard to debug parallel program

  * make use of parallel hardware

+ Terminology

  * Concurrent

    - can be fake parallelism based on fast switching
    - e.g. Unix Time-sharing system

  * Parallel

    - Tightly coupled
    - e.g. High performance computing cluster
    - e.g. Supercomputer

  * Distributed

    - Loosely coupled
    - grid computation
    - e.g. crypto network

+ Fundamental strategies

  * Data parallelism

    - divide the data into chunks
    - each chunk is processed in parallel

  * Task parallelism

    - divide the program into tasks
    - each task is executed in parallel

  * Hybrid

    - combine data parallelism and task parallelism

+ Coordination

  * Synchronization

    - lock
    - barrier

  * Communication

    - message passing
    - shared memory

  * Load balancing

    - static
    - dynamic

+ Parallel programming models

  * Shared memory

    - OpenMP
    - Pthreads

  * Message passing (distributed memory)

    - MPI

  * Data parallel

    - OpenCL (FYI)
    - CUDA (FYI)

  * Task parallel

    - OpenMP

  * Hybrid

    - MPI + OpenMP
    - MPI + Pthreads
