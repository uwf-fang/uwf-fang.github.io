Cloud Computing For Big Data
****************************
Definition of Cloud Computing
=============================
Cloud computing is a model for delivering on-demand access to shared
computing resources (such as servers, storage, applications, and services)
over the internet. Big data refers to large and complex datasets that cannot
be processed or analyzed using traditional data processing methods. Combining
cloud computing with big data technologies can help businesses to manage,
store, process and analyze their large datasets.

Characteristics
===============
* On-demand self-service: With on-demand self-service, users can access cloud
  computing resources and services quickly and easily, without needing to go
  through IT personnel. For example, a business may use a cloud computing
  service like Amazon Web Services (AWS) to spin up a cluster of virtual
  machines to process a large dataset. With just a few clicks, the business
  can provision the resources it needs and start processing data right away.
* Broad network access: Broad network access allows users to access cloud
  computing resources and services over the internet, enabling them to work
  from anywhere using any kind of devices. For example, a data scientist may
  need to access a large dataset stored in the cloud from their home office
  or while traveling. With cloud computing, they can access the data from
  anywhere with an internet connection.
* Resource pooling: Resource pooling enables multiple users to share
  computing resources and services, making it easier to scale up or down as
  demand changes. For example, a business may use a cloud computing service
  like Microsoft Azure to store and process large amounts of data. With
  resource pooling, the business can easily scale up or down its computing
  resources as needed, without needing to buy or maintain its own hardware.
* Rapid elasticity: Rapid elasticity enables users to quickly scale up or
  down their computing resources and services as needed. For example, a
  business may need to process a large amount of data for a short period of
  time, such as during a sales promotion. With cloud computing, the business
  can quickly provision the additional resources it needs to handle the
  workload, and then de-provision them when the promotion is over.
* Measured service: Measured service provides users with visibility into
  their usage of computing resources and services, enabling them to monitor
  and control costs more effectively. For example, a business may use a cloud
  computing service like Google Cloud Platform to store and process large
  amounts of data. With measured service, the business can track its usage of
  computing resources and services, and then adjust its usage to optimize
  costs.

Advantages of cloud computing
=============================
* Cost-effective: One of the key advantages of cloud computing is its
  cost-effectiveness. With cloud computing, businesses can avoid the high
  upfront costs associated with purchasing and maintaining their own hardware
  and software infrastructure. Instead, they can pay for computing resources
  and services on an as-needed basis, which can be more cost-effective over
  time. Additionally, cloud computing can help businesses to reduce their
  energy costs and carbon footprint by enabling them to use computing
  resources more efficiently. For example, a business may use a cloud-based
  file storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive instead of maintaining
  its own file servers, which can save money on hardware, energy, and
  maintenance costs.
* Scalable: Cloud computing is highly scalable, which means that businesses
  can easily adjust their computing resources and services to meet changing
  demands. With cloud computing, businesses can quickly provision additional
  computing resources when they need them and then de-provision them when
  they no longer need them. This can be particularly useful for businesses
  that experience spikes in demand, such as during peak sales periods or when
  launching new products. For example, a business may use a cloud-based
  e-commerce platform like Shopify or Magento to quickly scale up its online
  store during a busy holiday season.
* Flexible: Cloud computing is highly flexible, which means that businesses
  can choose the computing resources and services that best meet their needs.
  With cloud computing, businesses can choose from a wide range of computing
  resources and services, including storage, processing power, networking,
  and more. Additionally, businesses can easily switch between different
  cloud providers or services as their needs change. For example, a business
  may use a cloud-based email service like Gmail or Outlook instead of
  maintaining its own email server, which can provide greater flexibility and
  scalability.
* Reliable: Cloud computing is highly reliable, which means that businesses
  can expect high levels of uptime and availability. With cloud computing,
  businesses can rely on cloud providers to manage and maintain their
  computing resources and services, which can help to ensure that they are
  always available when needed. Additionally, cloud providers often offer
  backup and disaster recovery services, which can help businesses to recover
  quickly in the event of a data loss or outage. For example, a business may
  use a cloud-based backup service like Backblaze or Carbonite to ensure that
  its data is always backed up and protected.
* Secure: Cloud computing is highly secure, which means that businesses can
  trust that their data and computing resources are protected from cyber
  threats. With cloud computing, businesses can rely on cloud providers to
  implement security measures like encryption, firewalls, and access controls
  to protect their data and resources. Additionally, cloud providers often
  have highly trained security teams that can quickly respond to security
  threats or incidents. For example, a business may use a cloud-based
  security service like Cloudflare or Akamai to protect its website or online
  applications from cyber attacks.

Drawbacks of cloud computing
============================
* Cost: While cloud computing can be cost-effective, it can also be expensive
  in many cases.
* Data privacy: When you store your data in the cloud, you are entrusting it
  to a third-party provider, which can raise concerns about data privacy and
  security.
* Downtime: Cloud computing services can experience downtime, which can disrupt
  business operations and cause data loss. Cloud providers typically have
  service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee a certain level of uptime, but
  downtime can still occur.
* Security concerns: If your data is stored in the cloud, it is vulnerable to
  cyber attacks and data breaches. Cloud providers have implemented security
  measures to protect your data, but there is always a risk of unauthorized
  access or data loss.

Cloud computing service models
==============================
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): IaaS is a cloud computing model that
  provides businesses with virtualized computing resources, such as virtual
  machines, storage, and networking. With IaaS, businesses can easily
  provision and manage their own computing infrastructure, without the need
  to purchase and maintain physical hardware. Examples of IaaS providers
  include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud
  Platform (GCP).
* Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS is a cloud computing model that provides
  businesses with a platform for developing, deploying, and managing their
  own applications. With PaaS, businesses can focus on building and
  delivering applications, without the need to manage the underlying
  infrastructure. PaaS providers typically provide pre-built tools and
  services for application development, such as development frameworks,
  databases, and testing tools. Examples of PaaS providers include Heroku,
  Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure App Service.
* Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS is a cloud computing model that provides
  businesses with access to pre-built software applications that are hosted
  in the cloud. With SaaS, businesses can easily access and use software
  applications without the need to install or manage the software on their
  own devices or servers. SaaS applications can include a wide range of
  software, such as customer relationship management (CRM) tools, project
  management software, and email services. Examples of SaaS providers include
  Salesforce, Dropbox, and Microsoft Office 365.
* Function as a Service (FaaS): FaaS is a cloud computing model that provides
  businesses with serverless computing resources, which are used to run
  individual functions or pieces of code. With FaaS, businesses can focus on
  building and deploying specific functions or services, without the need to
  manage the underlying infrastructure. FaaS providers typically charge
  businesses based on the number of times their functions are executed or the
  amount of time they are executed for. Examples of FaaS providers include
  AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Microsoft Azure Functions.
