**************************
Objects and Classes in C++
**************************

Concepts
========

:object:  a collection of coherent states and behaviors
:class:  a template of a group of similar objects
:states:  data, property, attribute, member variable
:behavior:  method, member function

map to C++ concepts
-------------------

:class: a type
:object: a variable (instance) of a class type

Class declaration
=================

+ class keyword or struct keyword
+ visibility (access specifier)

  * as section (different from Java)
  * public:  accessible anywhere
  * private:  accessible only within objects of the same class
  * protected, etc.: not discussed here
  * always prefer information hiding

+ const methods: methods that cannot not modify any class variables

  - ``print() const {cout << "Hello!\n";}``

+ data initialization

Method definition
=================

+ location

  * separate
  * in-line

+ scope resolution operator ``::``
+ ``this`` pointer
+ type of methods

  - constructor
  - destructor
  - accessor
  - mutator
  - private helper

Using class/object
==================

- declare variable of class type
- ``.`` member accessing operator
