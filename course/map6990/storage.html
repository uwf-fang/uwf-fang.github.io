<h1>File systems/Storage services for Big Data<a class="headerlink" href="#file-systems-storage-services-for-big-data" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Hello! Today we will be discussing file systems for big data. Big data requires
storage and file systems that are capable of handling massive amounts of data.
In this session, we will be focusing on three file systems: Hadoop Distributed
File System (HDFS), Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) and Google Cloud
Storage.</p>
<section id="hadoop-distributed-file-system-hdfs">
<h2>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)<a class="headerlink" href="#hadoop-distributed-file-system-hdfs" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed file system that is part
of the Hadoop ecosystem. It is designed to store and manage large datasets
across multiple commodity servers and provides fault tolerance, scalability,
and high availability. HDFS is widely used in big data applications, such as
data processing, analytics, and machine learning, and it can handle large files
and data sets that exceed the capacity of a single machine.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Overview of HDFS architecture and components <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id3" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>HDFS is a distributed file system that is designed to store and manage
large datasets across multiple commodity servers. The HDFS architecture
consists of two main components: NameNode and DataNode. The NameNode
manages the file system metadata, including the namespace, access control,
and file-to-block mappings. The DataNode, on the other hand, manages the
actual data storage and retrieval operations. Multiple DataNodes are
deployed across the Hadoop cluster to provide fault tolerance and
scalability.</p>
</li>
<li><p>HDFS data organization (blocks, replication, rack awareness)</p>
<p>HDFS organizes data into blocks, which are fixed-size units of data that
can be spread across multiple DataNodes. The default block size is 128 MB,
but it can be configured based on the specific use case. HDFS also supports
replication, which is the process of making copies of each block across
multiple DataNodes to ensure data durability and availability. The
replication factor is typically set to three, but it can be adjusted based
on the storage capacity and performance requirements. HDFS also supports
rack awareness, which is the process of placing DataNodes on different
racks to ensure data availability and fault tolerance in case of rack
failures.</p>
</li>
<li><p>HDFS operations (reading, writing, appending, deleting)</p>
<p>HDFS provides basic file system operations, such as reading, writing,
appending, and deleting files. Reading and writing operations are performed
by the client application, which communicates with the NameNode to obtain
the file location and the DataNodes to read or write the data blocks.
Appending data to an existing file is also supported, but it requires
specific append-only semantics to ensure data consistency. Deleting files
is also supported, but it is a non-trivial operation that involves multiple
steps to remove the file metadata and the associated data blocks.</p>

<h2>Amazon S3 object store service<a class="headerlink" href="#amazon-s3-object-store-service" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Amazon S3 is a highly scalable, secure, and durable object storage service that
provides businesses with a simple and cost-effective way to store and retrieve
any amount of data from anywhere on the web. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id8" id="id5" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> S3 offers various storage
classes, data organization features, and operations to meet different use cases
and requirements. Read the official user guide for more details. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id9" id="id6" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>S3 storage classes <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id10" id="id7" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>S3 storage classes are designed to provide different levels of durability,
availability, and performance at different costs. The standard storage class
is suitable for frequently accessed data and offers high durability and
availability. The infrequent access (IA) variations of storage classes are
suitable for data that is accessed less frequently but needs to be readily
available when needed, and it offers lower storage costs but higher retrieval
costs. Glacier is a low-cost storage class that is designed for archiving
data for long-term retention and disaster recovery, with low retrieval costs
and high durability. When the needs are unknown,</p>
</li>
<li><p>S3 data organization (buckets, objects, keys)</p>
<p>S3 data organization is based on the concept of buckets, objects, and keys.
A bucket is a container for objects, and each object is identified by a
unique key. S3 allows for the creation of an unlimited number of buckets
and objects, with each object having a size limit of 5 terabytes. S3 also
supports versioning, which allows for the retention of multiple versions of
an object.</p>
</li>
<li><p>S3 operations (uploading, downloading, copying, deleting)</p>
<p>S3 operations provide a simple and intuitive interface for uploading,
downloading, copying, and deleting objects. Uploading objects to S3 can be
done through the AWS Management Console, API calls, command-line tools, or
third-party applications. Downloading objects can be done through a web
browser, API calls, or command-line tools. S3 also provides features such
as cross-region replication, lifecycle policies, and object tagging for
advanced management and automation of data.</p>

<h2>Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)<a class="headerlink" href="#azure-data-lake-storage-adls" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) is a cloud-based blob storage and management
service offered by Microsoft Azure. The concept of a blob is similar to the
concept of a bucket to Amazon S3. It is designed for big data scenarios and can
handle large-scale data analytics workloads. ADLS provides a hierarchical
namespace that allows users to organize and manage data in a structured manner.
The newest version in 2023 is Gen2. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id12" id="id11" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>6<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Overview of ADLS storage tiers</p>
<p>ADLS offers three different storage tiers, including hot, cool, and archive.
The hot tier is for frequently accessed data and has the lowest access
latency and highest cost. The cool tier is for less frequently accessed data
and has a higher access latency than the hot tier but lower cost. The archive
tier is for long-term storage of infrequently accessed data and has the
highest latency and lowest cost.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ADLS data organization</p>
<p>ADLS organizes data into a hierarchical file system, similar to a traditional
file system. It uses directories and files to store and organize data.
Directories can contain sub-directories, and files can be of any size.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ADLS operations</p>
<p>ADLS supports a variety of operations to manage and manipulate data stored in
the system. These operations include creating new files or directories,
reading data from files, updating files or directories, and deleting files or
directories. ADLS also supports access control and security features,
allowing users to manage access to data stored in the system.</p>

<h2>Google Cloud Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#google-cloud-storage" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Google Cloud Storage is a highly available and durable object storage service
provided by Google Cloud Platform. It is designed to store and manage large
data sets and supports various use cases such as backup and archive, big data
analytics, and content distribution. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id14" id="id13" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>7<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Google Cloud Storage classes</p>
<p>Google Cloud Storage offers four different storage classes, each with
different trade-offs between availability, performance, and cost. The
multi-regional class is for frequently accessed data and has the highest
availability and lowest access latency, but it is the most expensive. The
regional class is for data that is accessed less frequently than
multi-regional data but still needs low-latency access. The nearline class is
for data that is accessed infrequently but can tolerate longer access times.
Finally, the coldline class is for data that is accessed very rarely and can
tolerate high access latency.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Google Cloud Storage data organization</p>
<p>Google Cloud Storage organizes data into buckets, which are top-level
containers that can be used to store and access objects. Objects, in turn,
are files or pieces of data that can be uploaded, downloaded, and deleted
from a bucket. Objects are identified using a unique object name, called a
key.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Google Cloud Storage operations</p>
<p>Google Cloud Storage supports a variety of operations for managing and
manipulating data stored in the system, including uploading, downloading,
copying, and deleting objects. It also provides features such as access
control and versioning to manage access to data and keep track of changes to
objects.</p>
