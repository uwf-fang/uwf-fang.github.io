Learning outcome
================
+ Practice scientific background research
+ Practice how to design a big data application
+ Practice scientific background review writing
+ Practice scientific proposal writing

Objective
=========
Write a proposal like article on a big data problem you want to solve. In this
report, you must:

1. Identify the problem (<1 page)

   The data source must be big data. The problem must be big data problem. The
   problem must be interesting and challenging. The data should be extremely
   big in volume, or relative big but very complex for traditional machine
   learning model (text, image, sound, etc). You must have a good understanding
   of the dataset you plan to use. For data with big volume, you can use the
   processing tools to make it small enough for analysis. For complex data, you
   can either use some special tools to convert them or find the right deep
   learning models to directly consume them.

2. Review the background (2-3 pages)

   You must review the background of the problem. Carefully review the related
   articles and justify why your problem is big data and why it is interesting
   and challenging. The review should be systematic and comprehensive. Employ
   what you have learning in the course to organize the information you found.

3. Propose your method (1-2 pages)

   You must propose a solution to the problem. The solution must be feasible
   and interesting. The solution should be based on the knowledge you have
   learned in the course. The solution must be well justified. You do not need
   to provide a lot of details. You can provide a high level overview of the
   solution. List the steps of how you will go though the big data life cycle.
   List the tools you plan to use in each stage of the big data application.
   Also discuss how you are going to address all of the aspects in the big data
   life cycle. Details on how to used the tools are not required. You can
   provide a high level overview of how you will use the tools. You can also
   discuss the pros and cons of the tools you plan to use.

4. References (1 page)

Report Requirement
==================
+ A single page **Topic Proposal** due before the project to get approval from
  the instructor. You should focus on the justification on the topic (problem)
  as a valid big data project and also discuss your planned approach.
+ 4-5 pages letter size paper, 1.5 spacing, 12pt normal text font
+ Be organized and neat with headings, styles to separate sections
+ You can either use LaTeX or Microsoft Word
+ Provide image, figure, table, as needed; Do not forget to provide credit to
  the source of the image, figure, table
+ Use `MLA style <mla_>`_ or other professional format for citation and
  reference

Report Structure
================
**Your report is required to have the following sections:**

.. note::

  The bullet points listed under each section is the rubric that will be used. Do not use them as subsections! **Please show section titles explicitly!**

+ Abstract

  * Summarize the proposal in a concise manner
  * Clearly state the problem statement, research question, and objectives
  * Highlight the importance and relevance of the proposed research

+ Introduction

  * Introduce the research topic and the problem being addressed
  * Explain why the problem is important to study
  * State the research question and objectives

+ Background review

  * Review relevant literature and theoretical frameworks related to big data
    applications
  * Identify gaps or shortcomings in existing research
  * Provide a clear rationale for the proposed research based on the prior
    researches

+ Method

  * Clearly outline the research design and methodology, including data
    collection and analysis methods
  * Justify the choice of methodology and explain why it is appropriate for the
    research question and objectives
  * Discuss potential limitations or challenges of the proposed methodology

+ References

  * List all references cited in the proposal
  * Use a consistent MLA style

    - In-text citation: parenthesis with numbers like `in the article (1)`

.. warning::

   This section serves as a rubric that will be used to grade your project.

.. warning::

   Be careful with the difference between the introduction and background
   sections.

Pitfalls
========
+ Do not propose a problem that is not a big data problem. The key is that
  throughout the life cycle of the proposed application. Some sorts of big data
  tools must be required.
+ Good examples of big data projects

  * Start with large volume of data and the application must see all data to
    find the patterns.
  * Start with medium volume but data must be processed in real time or in a
    short period of time, so tools like Spark must be used
  * Start with medium or small volume to develop the model and plan to deploy
    the model to a large volume of data. The model must be able to handle the
    large volume of data.

+ Example of projects that are not big data projects

  * Involves large volume of data but there is

    - no need to process all at once
    - no need to work on the whole dataset
    - no need to aggregate the data distributed in different locations

  * Developing a deep learning model requires big volume of data. However,
    using that as an existing model in your application is not a big data
    project.

Data sources
------------
You do not need to download or own the dateset. You only need to identify it
and justify the problem is big data problem. Below are some example datasets.
**These datasets are not big data datasets.** They can server as a good start
point but you need learn from them and propose a plan to extend them to a big
data if you wish to use them. Some of these datasets are hard to extend, so
they can only be used for learning and inspirations.

+ Image datasets: Image datasets are widely available online and can be used
  for a variety of projects, such as object recognition, image classification,
  and facial recognition. Avoid small datasets, such as the MNIST dataset.
+ Text datasets: Text datasets can be used for natural language processing
  (NLP) projects, such as sentiment analysis, language modeling, and text
  classification. Some popular text datasets include the Reuters Corpus, the
  IMDB movie review dataset, and the Gutenberg Project.
+ Audio datasets: Audio datasets can be used for speech recognition and music
  analysis projects. Some popular audio datasets include the Speech Commands
  dataset, the UrbanSound8K dataset, and the Million Song Dataset.
+ Social media datasets: Social media datasets can be used for sentiment
  analysis, network analysis, and other social media-related projects. Some
  popular social media datasets include the Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset,
  the Reddit Comment dataset, and the Facebook100 dataset.
+ Health-related datasets: Health-related datasets can be used for projects
  related to healthcare, such as disease prediction and drug discovery. Some
  popular health-related datasets include the MIMIC-III dataset, the Breast
  Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, and the National Health and Nutrition
  Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset.

Methods
-------
Consider the following aspects when proposing the method.

+ Acquisition

  * Direct download of prepared datasets (public domain data source)
  * Web scraping to collect data from websites
  * Application programming interface (API) to collect data from social media
    platforms
  * Sensor data collection

+ Processing

  * Hadoop
  * Spark

+ Analysis

  * Traditional statistical analysis
  * Traditional machine learning
  * Deep learning

+ Storage (discuss options for all stages)

  * HDFS
  * Cloud services
  * NoSQL

+ Security and management
