Problem Classification
**********************
Classifying computational problems is paramount in the realm of algorithm
design and optimization. It enables algorithm selection by matching problem
types with suitable algorithms, streamlining resource allocation for efficient
computing, and guiding algorithm development and analysis. By categorizing
problems based on their inherent attributes, we can identify common
problem-solving strategies and design algorithms tailored to specific problem
categories. This classification also aids in benchmarking and evaluating
algorithm performance, allowing researchers and practitioners to assess the
effectiveness of various algorithms in solving similar problem types,
ultimately advancing the field of algorithmic research and development.

By The Goal
===========
+ Find a(n) optimal/near-optimal solution - optimization
+ Find whether something is true or false - decision
+ Find a solution that satisfies given criteria - search
+ Find all solutions that satisfies given criteria - enumeration
+ Find how many ways to do something - counting
+ Find the output of a mathematical or logical function - evaluation problem
