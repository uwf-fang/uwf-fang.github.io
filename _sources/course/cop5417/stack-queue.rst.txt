Stack and Queue in Java
***********************

Common Characteristics
======================
+ Typical ADTs
+ Linear (one after another)
+ Access data from terminal position(s)

Stack
=====
+ LIFO (Last In First Out)
+ Behaviors

  * push
  * pop
  * peek
  * isEmpty

+ Implementation

  * Linked list

    - minimal: singly linked list with a head/first reference variable

  * Array (self study)

Queue
=====
+ FIFO (First In First Out)
+ Behaviors

  * enqueue
  * dequeue
  * peek
  * isEmpty

+ Implementation

  * Linked list

    - minimal: singly linked list with a head/first and a tail/last reference
      variables
    - add at tail and remove at head

  * Array (self study)

Interface and generic
=====================
+ Defined as interfaces as they are ADTs
+ Employ generic to support different data types of data
