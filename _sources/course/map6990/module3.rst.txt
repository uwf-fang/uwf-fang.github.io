Module 3: Big Data Life Cycle; Data Processing For Big Data
***********************************************************
The definition of the term "data process" varies greatly between sources. Some
refer to it as a simple data transformation step. Some define it as the entire
process of big data application life cycle, including all stages defined here.
All of them are correct in their own context, but I'd like to define mine to
help with the teaching process.

As a result, before diving into data processing for big data, I'd like to walk
you through the life cycle of most big data applications and explain my
definition of "data process." In the next section, data processing topic will
be covered.
