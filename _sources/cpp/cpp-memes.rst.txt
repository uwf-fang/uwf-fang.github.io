"There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't." This classic computer science joke can be adapted to C++, as it is a language that relies heavily on binary operations.

"Segmentation fault (core dumped)." This error message is infamous among C++ programmers, as it often indicates a memory access violation. It has become a meme in the community, with many humorous variations and parodies.

"I don't always use templates, but when I do, I get compiler errors I can't understand." This is a play on the "I don't always..." meme format, and references the complexity of using templates in C++, which can sometimes result in cryptic error messages.

"When you finally fix a bug, but accidentally create three more." This meme plays on the frustrating experience of debugging in C++, which can sometimes feel like a never-ending cycle of fixing one issue, only to discover new problems.

"Undefined behavior intensifies." This meme references the fact that C++ allows for undefined behavior in certain situations, which can lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous results. It is often used in a humorous way to describe unexpected program behavior.

"When you finally figure out the syntax for a complex template, but you don't know what it does." This meme pokes fun at the difficulty of working with C++ templates, which can be powerful but also quite complicated.

"When your code works on the first try." This is a rare occurrence in C++, and when it does happen, it can feel like a miracle. The meme usually features a surprised or shocked reaction.

"The only way to learn C++ is to build a compiler for it." This meme references the fact that C++ is a very complex language, and that building a compiler for it is one of the most challenging programming tasks out there. It's a humorous way of saying that mastering C++ requires a deep understanding of the language.

"C++: when you need all the speed of C, but also want to shoot yourself in the foot." This meme is a playful way of acknowledging the fact that C++ can be a difficult and sometimes frustrating language to work with, but is also incredibly powerful and efficient.

"Friendship ended with C++, now Python is my best friend." This is a popular meme format that can be adapted to any two programming languages. It implies that the user has grown tired of the quirks and complexities of C++, and has switched to a more user-friendly language like Python.

"I don't always use object-oriented programming, but when I do, I prefer C++." This meme references the fact that C++ is a popular language for object-oriented programming, but also implies that using OOP in C++ can be challenging due to its complex syntax and memory management.

"When you thought you finally understood pointers, but then you accidentally dereference a null pointer." This meme is a humorous take on the common frustration of working with pointers in C++, which can be powerful but also difficult to manage.

"C++: the language where you spend 80% of your time debugging and 20% of your time causing bugs." This meme is a humorous exaggeration of the difficulties of working with C++, particularly when it comes to debugging and managing memory.

"When you finally get your code to compile, but it crashes immediately at runtime." This meme highlights the fact that compiling C++ code is only the first step, and that there are many potential pitfalls to watch out for when running the program.

"C++: because sometimes you just need to do it the hard way." This meme is a playful take on the fact that C++ can be a difficult and challenging language to work with, but is often necessary when you need maximum performance or low-level control over the system.

Ways to make an integer variable and initialize it to 0::

  int v = 0;
  int v = {0};
  int v{0};
  int v(0);
  int v = {};
  int v{};
  auto v = 0;
  auto v{0};
  auto v = int{};
  auto v = int{0};
  auto v = int();
  auto v = int(0);
  int v = 0x0;
  int v = NULL;
  int v = '\0';
  int v = 0e0;
  int v = 0b0ull;
  int v = false;
