***********************************************
Module 3: Shared-Memory Programming with OpenMP
***********************************************
Characteristics
===============
+ A shared-memory programming model.
+ Modifies existing serial program
+ Include library header ``omp.h``
+ Preprocessor directive ``Pragma``
+ Requires compiler level support
+ Thread based

Compile and run
===============
gcc
---
+ include omp.h
+ compile with ``-fopenmp`` flag

Concepts
========

.. glossary::

  pragmas
    The preprocessor directive employed by OpenMP. Employ **clauses** to fine
    control the parallelized behavior. It works like a domain specific
    language.

  Structured block
    The code block to be parallelized by OpenMP. It can be a for/while/do-while
    statement, a function call or a code block enclosed by ``{}``

  Threads (OpenMP)
    OpenMP will fork threads to execute the structured block. The collection of
    threads is called **Team**. There is a **master** thread to execute the
    codes that are not parallelized and the rest of threads are known as
    **slave**, which execute the structured block only.

  Synchronization
    A mechanism to constraint the ordering of execution of instructions to
    preclude potential problems such as racing condition, and other
    inconsistency problems.

  Variable Scope (OpenMP)
    As OpenMP is not part of C standard, the scope of variables in the
    structured block needs special handling. The can be defined as ``private``
    or ``shared`` in OpenMP ``pragma`` directives. The default scope of
    variables declared outside of the block is ``shared``, while the default
    scope of variables declared inside the block is ``private``.

Clauses
=======
+ parallel
+ num_threads
+ private
+ shared
+ default
+ reduction
+ for
+ schedule

  * static
  * dynamic
  * guided

+ critical
+ atomic
+ barrier

Synchronization
===============
+ critical section
+ atomic
+ barrier
+ mutual exclusion (locks)

  * omp_set_lock
  * omp_unset_lock

Examples
