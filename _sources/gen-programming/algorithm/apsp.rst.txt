All Pairs Shortest Path Algorithms
==================================

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
------------------------
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses dynamic programming to iteratively update the
shortest distances between all pairs of vertices.

+ invented by Robert Floyd and Stephen Warshall

Pseudo-code for the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

  :caption: Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

  function floyd_warshall(graph):
    initialize a distance matrix with infinite values
    set diagonal entries to 0 (distance to itself)

    for each edge (u, v) with weight w in the graph:
      set distance[u][v] = w

    for k in all vertices:
      for i in all vertices:
        for j in all vertices:
          if distance[i][j] > distance[i][k] + distance[k][j]:
            set distance[i][j] = distance[i][k] + distance[k][j]
