Definition
==========
An algorithm is a precise, step-by-step set of instructions or a well-defined
computational procedure that solves a particular problem or performs a specific
task. Algorithms are fundamental in computer science and programming, providing
a systematic approach to solving complex problems by breaking them down into
simpler, understandable operations. They can be expressed in various forms,
including pseudocode or actual programming code, and are used to perform tasks
such as sorting data, searching for information, or carrying out mathematical
calculations. The efficiency and correctness of an algorithm are crucial
factors in determining its effectiveness in solving real-world problems and
optimizing computer programs.

Context
=======
+ Closely related to imperative programming paradigm.
+ Can be designed based on algorithmic paradigms.
+ May be part of a data structure.
+ May be part of another algorithm.
+ May require certain data structures or ADTs in the implementation.

Characteristics
===============
+ Well-defined: The steps of an algorithm must be clear and unambiguous.
+ Deterministic: The algorithm must produce the same output for a given input.
+ Finite: The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
+ Efficient: The algorithm must be efficient in terms of time and space
  complexity.
+ Input and output: The algorithm must have zero or more inputs and at least
  one output.
