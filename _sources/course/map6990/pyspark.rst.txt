Environment
===========
Local
-----
You can try installing it on your own computer in a single node mode. You will
need a UNIX like environment.

Remote
------
We will use a remote environment called Google Colab to simplify the
installation.

Google Colab
============
Google Colaboratory (also known as Google Colab or simply Colab) is a
cloud-based platform that allows users to write, run, and share Python code
using Jupyter notebooks. It is a free service provided by Google that allows
users to access powerful computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, without
the need for expensive hardware.

With Colab, you can easily create and share documents that contain live code,
equations, visualizations, and text. You can also collaborate with others in
real-time, making it an ideal tool for data science teams, researchers,
educators, and students.
