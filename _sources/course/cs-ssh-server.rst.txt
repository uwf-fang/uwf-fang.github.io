Remote Linux Server Tutorial
****************************

There are several Linux servers available to CS students for teaching purposes.
The servers can be accessed through secure shell (SSH). The host name for the
servers is **ssh.cs.uwf.edu** (or **cs-ssh.uwf.edu**).

SSH client
==========

You will need an SSH client to connect to the remote server. The standard
command-line environments mostly come with a ``ssh`` command that you can invoke
to connect to servers providing ssh service. These environments include the
**terminal** app available on Linux, Mac OS and Windows Subsystem for Linux
(WSL).

To connect to an SSH server on Windows without a terminal, you will need a
standalone SSH client software. The most popular SSH client on Windows is Putty.
You can find it free online and install it.

SSH command
===========

You need to know the basic SSH command usage to connect to a remote server in
your terminal. The syntax looked like::

  ssh ssh.cs.uwf.edu

Or the following if you have a different username (uname in the example) on the
remote server compared to your local username::

  ssh uname@ssh.cs.uwf.edu

You will be asked if the server looked safe in your first attempt to connect.
Just type yes. Then, input your password to log into the Linux. You may add your
public key to the server to avoid future hustle to input passwords. Do your
research on how to set up a key pair to use with SSH for instant login.

Linux server
============

Once you are logged in. You will be manipulating the remote Linux the same way
as you can do with your local Linux in its terminal. You need some knowledge of
basic Linux commands to do your work on the server. The common Linux command can
be found here.

.. glossary::

  ls
    List all objects in a directory. Add the ``-l`` option to list in a
    long format. Add the ``-a`` option to list all including hidden objects.
    This command can be followed by a list of objects to be listed. Listing a
    directory will show objects in the directory. Listing a file object will
    list a single file.

  cd
    Change the working directory to a new location. You can use ``cd ..`` to
    change to the parent directory. ``..`` represents the parent directory in
    Linux. Learn Linux directory structure for more information. A typical Linux
    path looked like ``/usr/lib/lab.so`` in which the slash symbol is the
    delimiter.

  mkdir
    Followed by a directory name to make a directory or a list of names to make
    several directories.

  rm
    Remove objects. Can remove files or directories. Add ``-r`` to remove a directory recursively.

  man
    Show the manual of a command. E.g. ``man ls`` to show the manual for the
    ``ls`` command.

  ./main
    Run a program called ``main`` in the current directory. Must provide ``./``
    before the name. ``.`` represent the current directory in Linux. You can
    change main to the name of any program in the current directory to run it.

Refer to this :download:``Linux cheat sheet</_static/linux_cheatsheet.pdf>`` for
more information.

Edit in the SSH window
======================

To edit a remote file directly in the terminal or SSH client window. You must
use a command-line editor like ``vi``, ``vim``, ``nano``, etc. ``vim`` is an
enhanced ``vi`` editor and is widely used as a command-line text based editor.
``vim`` is extremely powerful, but at the same time hard to learn and
master. Many programmers found it worth the time to learn it, including myself.
You can learn several most basic operations in ``vim`` to get it started to edit
your code.

When you type the command ``vim main.cpp`` in the command line, you will enter
the full screen edit mode and your main.cpp file will be opened. You can press
``i`` key (case sensitive) to enter the *insert mode* and type your content.
Press ``Esc`` to exit the *insert mode* and type ``:wq`` to save and quit.

To learn more about vim, check out the
:download:``introduction to VI</_static/intro_vi.pdf>`` and
:download:``VI cheatsheet</_static/vi_ref.pdf>`` documents.

The ``nano`` command can invoke a simpler text editor. You can learn how to use
nano if you prefer a simpler editor.

.. note::

  You always have the option to edit your code on your own computer and transfer to the server. So you do not have to edit in the terminal window.

File Transfer
=============

As mentioned above, you can transfer locally edited files to the server instead
of creating and editing in the terminal window. There are many tools supporting
file transferring through an SSH connection (SFTP):

+ Command line tools: ``scp``, ``rsync``
+ GUI tools: **WinSCP**, **FileZilla**

.. warning::

  If you are transferring a file generated on Windows using certain editors, you
  may experience line ending problem. The transferred file cannot be compiled
  because of the Windows line ending. You have to use a tool called ``dos2unix``
  to convert the line ending characters. Unfortunately, this tool is not
  pre-installed on many Linux servers. One solution is to use an editor on
  Windows that can save files using the Unix line ending. It is know to work in
  VS code and you can perform a web search to see if your favorite editor will provide the option.
