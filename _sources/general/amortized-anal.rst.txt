Amortized Analysis
******************

Amortized analysis is a mathematical technique employed in the realm of
computer science and algorithm analysis. It offers a more refined and
comprehensive approach to evaluating the time complexity of algorithms that
involve a sequence of operations, especially those with variable costs.

Especially useful for data structures changes their size and structure
dynamically. Example including dynamic arrays, hash tables, self-balancing
binary search trees, and splay trees.

Types of Amortized Analysis
===========================
+ Aggregate Analysis

  Aggregate analysis is the simplest method of amortized analysis. It involves
  determining the total cost of a sequence of operations and then dividing this
  cost by the number of operations to determine the amortized cost.

+ Accounting Method

  This method involves assigning "credits" and "debits" to different operations
  in a way that the total credits always cover the total cost of the
  operations. The goal is to distribute the cost of expensive operations across
  multiple operations, making the average cost more predictable.

+ Potential Method

  The potential method defines a "potential function" that represents the
  stored energy in a data structure after each operation. Changes in potential
  are used to offset the actual cost of operations, ensuring that the amortized
  cost remains relatively constant.
