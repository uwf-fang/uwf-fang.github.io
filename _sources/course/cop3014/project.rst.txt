Grading
=======
The grading system of complex projects differs greatly from that used in
entry-level courses and in coding questions in exams:

+ **Your code must compile and run!**
+ **The grader grades your code by running rather than by reading them!**
+ A program compiles and runs through ``GNU make`` using commands like
  ``make``, ``./main``, ``make test-all``, ``make test-run``, etc.
+ **You should not expect any partial credits for code that cannot be tested by
  running your program.** The grader do not have the responsibility to read,
  debug and understand your unfinished source code.

Project Workflow
================
This workflow is beginner oriented. Students may develop their own workflow as
they gain experience in programming. However, there is still something even the
experienced students can learn from here.

Design/Modelling Stage
----------------------
In this workflow I assume that you start from a problem description to finish
an application to solve a problem. In the real-world projects,
many steps are already finished and you will be asked to start from
implementation specification such as UML class diagrams, detailed descriptions
of functions or classes. You will be skipping the design/modeling step in these
cases.

#. Understand the problem

   Read the description carefully! Clarify obscure or ambiguous descriptions
   with your instructor. Estimate the complexity of the whole project and make
   a time management plan.

#. Analyze and model the problem (two approaches)

   + use top-down design to break the questions into functions (tasks)
   + use object-oriented design to break the question into classes

#. Plan your project directory

   Consider the directory structure of the project, the files to create, the
   makefile to write, etc.

#. Make a skeleton of the project

   Create all files including cpp files, hpp files, supporting
   data/configuration files, and a makefile. Fill them with empty functions,
   empty classes, header guards, know includes, etc.

Implementation Stage
--------------------
A skeleton repository may be provided for you to use in a GitHub
Classroom-based assignment. Run ``git clone <URL>`` to clone it to your
computer. It may also be provided as a zip file downloadable from Canvas.

#. Iterative development

   #. Backup your files (three options)

      + best with a version control system like git. Just add and commit using
        ``git add -A`` and ``git commit -m "commit message"``
      + compress the directory and give it a serial number or a date time stamp
      + duplicate the directory and give it a serial number or a date time
        stamp

   #. Pick a unit to work with

      + start from the simple units first ("simple" means simple in logic and
        not depending on other units)
      + move on to units depending on finished units

   #. Write code in small units (function, class, class method)
   #. Write a test driver (sometimes provided)
   #. Write rules in makefile to build and run the tests (sometimes provided)
   #. Fix problems found in the run
   #. Proceed to the next iteration

#. Perform a final test on everything
#. Upload to Canvas

   #. Duplicate your project directory
   #. Change the directory to the base name of your submission file like
     ``proj#``. Substitute # with your project number.
   #. Change to the new directory in your terminal with :code:`cd`
   #. Remove files not needed in the submission (the ``make clean`` command
     should do most if not all of the clean up job for you)
   #. Perform a last test on everything
   #. Clean the generated files in the test run using ``make clean`` again
   #. Compress your directory using zip format and name it as ``proj#.zip``
   #. Find the Canvas assignment page and upload
   #. Visit the page again to confirm the uploaded file is there

Build, run and debug
====================
Due to the complexity of compiling and running your modular project manually,
building tools such as GNU make, Autotools, Cmake, Ninja, Meson are employed to
automate the process. We employ ``GNU make`` in our course.

Make command-lines
------------------
The ``make`` command-lines commonly employed in the projects are:

+ ``make``
+ ``make all`` to compile multiple targets
+ ``make main`` to compile main
+ ``make test-run`` to test run your main
+ ``make test`` to compile and run a test
+ ``make test-all`` to compile and run multiple tests
+ ``make test-#-xxx`` to compile and run one of the many tests where # is a
  number, and xxx is a name of the individual test

You must compile and run your code through these commands because this is how
the grader will employ in the grading.

Provided Tests
--------------
+ Tests are provided in some starting code bases to facilitate grading.
+ Students are not supposed to change source codes in the test directory or the
  cpp files provided for test such as ``test.cpp``.
+ Make sure your filenames follows the naming convention so the makefile will
  work properly. The convention requires all lowercase filenames.
+ Complete the makefile as needed.
+ Run ``make test`` or ``make test-all`` to run tests.
+ You can find other ``test-#-xxx`` kind of targets in your makefile to run
  tests separately.
+ Make good use of these tests locally to test your code.
+ A major portion of grading will be based on the tests runs.


Get Help
========
+ Post sharable problems on the Discord server
+ Email the instructor or TA about the question. Must include your code.

.. warning::

  **Never ask me question with only limited information like screenshots or
  error messages.** Attach the zip file of your source code files in your
  email.

Avoid Common Mistakes
=====================
1. Avoid over-engineering

   + Understand the problem and requirements very well
   + Work toward a just-enough solution (follow the instruction) rather than a
     perfect solution
   + Choose the simplest (simple to use) data structures, not the fastest or
     coolest ones (e.g. choose vector over C array, string over C string)

#. Avoid bad submission

   + Run ``make clean`` before add and commit
   + Remove any added files and directories not needed in the submission. They
     are usually from your editor or IDE and can be huge in size.

#. Avoid wasting time on anything not required in the instruction

   + Read instruction carefully
   + Ask questions if you are not sure

#. Avoid last minute rush

   + Projects are usually more challenging than you think
   + You will not learn much in the rush

#. Avoid writing code without testing

   + Any project beyond a certain size should be finished in an incremental
     manner and tested in every step
   + In the future, you may want to learn a testing framework but for now tests
     can be as simple as an extra .cpp file with a main function to run the
     classes or functions you just finished. Just feed the object/function with
     some input data and check the output. Testing code should be in a separate
     cpp file
   + A testing framework (e.g. Catch2) will greatly improve this process but
     need learning
   + A final test on the SSH server recommended to avoid compatibility problems
     (not necessary if your code are graded on GitHub)

#. Avoid working without backing up your code

   + It is common to lose important code snippet by mistake
   + You will hesitate to try new idea
   + Do backup your changes frequently
   + Do keep a log of your progress
   + If possible, using a version control system is the best solution
