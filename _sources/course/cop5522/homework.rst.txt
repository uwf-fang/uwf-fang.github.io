Homework Instruction
********************

This programming assignment consists of three integral parts: coding,
conducting experiments, and report writing. It's essential to give each section
equal importance to ensure comprehensive understanding and successful
completion of the task at hand. Here's a breakdown of what's expected for each
part:

Coding
======
1. Code Optimization
--------------------

- Begin by analyzing the provided code thoroughly.
- Identify areas of improvement and potential inefficiencies.
- Develop an optimized version that enhances performance while maintaining
  functionality.
- **Do not optimize the code blindly.** Focus on code blocks that consume the
  most time and resources.
- It is a good practice to make your program focusing on running only a single
  experiment. Code for automation can be added later as separated script.

2. Documentation & Clarity
--------------------------

- Ensure every function, class, and module is accompanied by concise and clear
  comments explaining its purpose and functionality.
- Any complex logic or algorithms used should have inline comments for better
  understanding. **No need to comment anything that is easy to understand.**
- It's not just about writing comments but making the code itself
  self-explanatory through meaningful variable and function names.

3. Makefile
-----------

- Provide a Makefile to streamline the compilation process.
- The Makefile should support multiple targets as necessary, allowing for
  flexibility in compilation and testing.

  * When optimizations are from compilation flags, make separate targets for
    each optimization in your Makefile.

- Ensure the Makefile is free of errors and can successfully compile the code
  without issues.


4. Coding Style Consistency
---------------------------

- Adopt a consistent coding style throughout your work. This includes
  consistent indentation, naming conventions, and code structure.
- If you're following any particular coding guidelines or standards, ensure you
  adhere to them strictly.
- Consistency aids in readability and maintainability, making it easier for
  others (and yourself) to review and understand your code in the future.

.. note::

  Remember, well-written code is not just functional, but also clean, readable, and maintainable. Aim for clarity and simplicity wherever possible.

Work with data
==============
1. Data Collection

   - You may write scripts for automation to feed various inputs to your
     program and collect results.
   - Results can be ideally in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format for easy
     processing and analysis.
   - Manually input the data into a spreadsheet is also an option, but it's
     time-consuming and prone to errors.

2. Data Processing

   - Please follow the :doc:`Data Processing Guide </research/data-guide>` for
     effective data management.

3. Data Presentation

   - Plots are the best way to visualize your data.
   - Types

    * Line plot: show trends of series, focus on trend
    * Bar plot: show comparison of values in series
    * Scatter plot: show the relationship between two variables or the
      distribution of data in two-dimensional space
    * Histogram: show the distribution of data in one-dimensional space

  - Useful plots in this course

    * Trend of run time: line plot, X: input size, Y: run time, Series: the
      optimization
    * Strong scaling: line plot, X: number of processes, Y: speedup, Series:
      input size
    * Weak scaling: line plot, X: number of processes, Y: speedup, Series:
      input size per process
