<section id="machine-learning">
<h2>Machine Learning<a class="headerlink" href="#machine-learning" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Machine learning is a powerful approach to developing intelligent systems that
has seen significant growth in recent years. It is an interdisciplinary field
that combines principles from computer science, statistics, mathematics, and
other areas to create algorithms and models that can learn and make predictions
from data. Machine learning is often used in applications where traditional
rule-based programming is impractical or impossible, such as detecting fraud in
financial transactions, recommending products to customers, and diagnosing
medical conditions.</p>
<section id="evolution">
<h3>Evolution<a class="headerlink" href="#evolution" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The field of artificial intelligence has evolved significantly over the years,
from rule-based systems that relied on expert knowledge to more modern
data-driven approaches that use machine learning and data mining. Rule-based
systems were based on a set of explicit rules and knowledge provided by human
experts. These rules were used to make decisions and perform tasks, but their
effectiveness was limited by the ability of experts to capture all the
necessary knowledge and encode it in a set of rules.</p>
<p>In contrast, data-driven systems leverage the power of machine learning
algorithms to automatically extract patterns and knowledge from large datasets.
Data mining techniques are used to identify patterns and relationships in the
data, which can be used to make predictions and decisions. The advantage of
data-driven approaches is that they can capture complex patterns and
relationships that may be difficult or impossible for humans to identify.</p>
<p>As the volume and complexity of data continue to increase, data-driven
approaches are becoming more essential in many fields. Machine learning
algorithms can be used to analyze and make predictions in areas such as
finance, healthcare, and transportation. While rule-based systems are still
used in some areas, data-driven approaches have become increasingly popular due
to their ability to extract knowledge from large and complex datasets. Overall,
the shift from rule-based to data-driven systems represents a significant
evolution in the field of artificial intelligence and has opened up many new
opportunities for intelligent systems to solve complex problems.</p>

<section id="types-of-learning-tasks">
<h3>Types of learning tasks<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-learning-tasks" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Supervised Learning:</p>
<p>Supervised learning is a type of learning task that involves the use of
labeled data, where the algorithm is trained using inputs and corresponding
outputs. It can be further divided into two categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Classification: Classification is a type of supervised learning where the
algorithm learns to predict a discrete output. For example, predicting
whether an email is spam or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Regression: Regression is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm
learns to predict a continuous output. For example, predicting the price of
a house.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unsupervised Learning:</p>
<p>Unsupervised learning is a type of learning task that involves the use of
unlabeled data. In this type of learning, the algorithm learns patterns and
relationships within the data without any specific guidance or target output.
It can be further divided into two categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Clustering: Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning where the
algorithm groups similar data points together. For example, grouping
customers based on their purchase history.</p></li>
<li><p>Dimension reduction: Dimension reduction is a type of unsupervised learning
where the algorithm reduces the number of variables in the data while
preserving its underlying structure. For example, reducing the number of
variables in an image while preserving its visual features. It can also be
employed to visualize data in 2D and 3D plots.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reinforcement Learning:</p>
<p>Reinforcement learning is a type of learning task where an agent learns to
interact with an environment to achieve a specific goal. The agent receives
rewards or punishments based on its actions and learns to make optimal
decisions to maximize the cumulative reward.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semi-Supervised Learning:</p>
<p>Semi-supervised learning is a type of learning task that involves the use of
both labeled and unlabeled data. In this type of learning, the algorithm
learns from the labeled data and uses the unlabeled data to improve its
performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Self-Supervised Learning:</p>
<p>Self-supervised learning is a type of learning task that involves the use of
labeled data generated by the algorithm itself. In this type of learning, the
algorithm creates a task based on the input data, and the output is used as
the label for the same input data. For example, predicting the missing pixels
in an image.</p>
<p>Self-Supervised learning is extensively used in deep learning training.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ensemble Learning</p>
<p>These models combine multiple machine learning models to improve performance.
Examples of ensemble learning models include bagging, boosting, and stacking.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transfer learning</p>
<p>Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where knowledge gained from
training a model on one task is leveraged to improve the performance on a
new, related task. Rather than starting the learning process from scratch,
transfer learning enables the reuse of pre-trained models, which can save
time and computational resources while also improving the accuracy of the new
model. The pre-trained model’s learned features and representations can be
fine-tuned on the new data or used to extract useful features that are then
fed into a new model. Transfer learning has been widely used in many domains,
such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition,
and has proven to be an effective way to tackle many real-world problems with
limited labeled data.</p>

<h4>Trending Deep Learning Models<a class="headerlink" href="#trending-deep-learning-models" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The field of AI models has seen explosive growth since the publication of
ChatGPT in 2022. With big companies and organizations now investing in this
technology, it has become increasingly difficult for smaller institutions and
individuals to train these models from scratch. As a result, many researchers
and application developers are turning to pre-trained models from these
organizations or using APIs provided by them. By employing techniques such as
fine-tuning or few-shot learning, these developers can easily adapt pre-trained
models to their specific tasks. This approach not only saves time and resources
but also allows for the creation of highly accurate and sophisticated AI models
that were previously out of reach for many smaller organizations and
individuals.</p>

<li><p>Large language models (LLM)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>GPT family from OpenAI: GPT-3, GPT-4, ChatGPT</p></li>
